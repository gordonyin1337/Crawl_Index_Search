Children raised here are trained to pilot giant mechas known as FranXX\xe2\x80\x94the only weapons known to be effective against the Klaxosaurs\xe2\x80\x94in boy-girl pairs. Bred for the sole purpose of piloting these machines, these children know nothing of the outside world and are only able to prove their existence by defending their race. Hiro, an aspiring FranXX pilot, has lost his motivation and self-confidence after failing an aptitude test. Skipping out on his class&#039; graduation ceremony, Hiro retreats to a forest lake, where he encounters a mysterious girl with two horns growing out of her head. She introduces herself by her codename Zero Two, which is known to belong to an infamous FranXX pilot known as the &quot;Partner Killer.&quot; Before Hiro can digest the encounter, the Plantation is rocked by a sudden Klaxosaur attack. Zero Two engages the creature in her FranXX, but it is heavily damaged in the skirmish and crashes near Hiro. Finding her partner dead, Zero Two invites Hiro to pilot the mecha with her, and the duo easily defeats the Klaxosaur in the ensuing fight. With a new partner by his side, Hiro has been given a chance at redemption for his past failures, but at what cost?

surviving humans to take refuge in massive fortress cities called Plantations. Children raised here are trained to pilot giant mechas known as FranXX&mdash;the only weapons known to be effective against the Klaxosaurs&mdash;in boy-girl pairs. Bred for the sole purpose of piloting these machines, these children know nothing of the outside world and are only able to prove their existence by defending their race.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHiro, an aspiring FranXX pilot, has lost his motivation and self-confidence after failing an aptitude test. Skipping out on his class&#039; graduation ceremony, Hiro retreats to a forest lake, where he encounters a mysterious girl with two horns growing out of her head. She introduces herself by her codename Zero Two, which is known to belong to an infamous FranXX pilot known as the &quot;Partner Killer.&quot; Before Hiro can digest the encounter, the Plantation is rocked by a sudden Klaxosaur attack. Zero Two engages the creature in her FranXX, but it is heavily damaged in the skirmish and crashes near Hiro. Finding her partner dead, Zero Two invites Hiro to pilot the mecha with her, and the duo easily defeats the Klaxosaur in the ensuing fight.

contains spoilers for this predictable show. I have specifically and very clearly marked the spoiler sections (there aren&#039;t as many as you think, only 3 paragraphs\xe2\x80\x99 worth) so you can still easily read my review and do not need to worry. As for the fans of the show, enter at your own volition since you will not find this review to exalt it in any manner, so to those who consider FranXX a 10/10, keep your temper in and let&#039;s begin. If you&#039;re a regular reader, please carry on :)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFranXX was hyped a lot. And that&#039;s just the short of it, it\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review283195">\n        had a huge marketing campaign and had a huge amount of anticipation with people calling it the \xe2\x80\x9cNext Evangelion\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cSpiritual successor to Eva\xe2\x80\x9d and so on and so forth. The legendary Yabuki Kentarou was signed on doing the art for the manga adaptation for this unoriginal original and as a matter of fact, that&#039;s how I found out about the show in the first place and went in expecting the amazing show the marketing had me believe. Result? Well I can&#039;t surprise you since you might have seen the score I gave it. Yes. A mess. A terrible mess.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo begin with, the main part that is the reason fans gloss over this show, the characters. They are given little to no backstories and their roles to play are very less. Squad 13 mainly served as a bumbling group of teenagers (hmm\xe2\x80\xa6 why teenagers in particular?) who don&#039;t know jackshit except for the so called \xe2\x80\x9cfact\xe2\x80\x9d that they must pilot the mechs known as FranXX and defeat these blue magma lover monsters called Klaxosaurs. Let that seep in. Why children? Most likely because they wanna appeal to the target audience of the show, teenagers. Unfortunately, that doesn&#039;t seem to be as fruitful as A-1 and Trigger thought it would because when you&#039;ve got an idiotic group of teenagers who contribute nothing to character development, I don&#039;t think you end up with teenage viewers going crazy over a show. I mean, yes, teens in real life aren&#039;t always smart, but if given the chance, I&#039;m sure they&#039;d do something sensible when they need to, but we don&#039;t see such a thing at all. Why? All we see is random blushes and such stuff. I mean, these teens are acting like everyday teens, yes, that&#039;s fine but is this the premise to do so? A place where people are bombarded by the constant threat of Klaxosaurs? Kids are supposed to have fun yes, but not when you&#039;re literally guarding human lives from danger. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo move away from the characters for a moment, we move to another problem with the show, its connection. And don&#039;t you dare justify it by telling me it&#039;s an episodic anime, because it sure as hell is not. In reality, it&#039;s just mixed up completely and had too many ideas to implement together and instead of choosing one idea to go with, they probably chose all and excellently failed at all of them. Why? Poor connection. To hold up a plot you need connection, FranXX didn&#039;t offer any of that at all. It just dragged on and didn&#039;t leave any mention of what happened before and most importantly WHY the situation happened before. What could possibly be the reason behind this? Simple. Bad direction. All it takes to destroy the whole hard work of a show is bad direction. In fact, about 90% of the issues with the anime can be traced back to bad direction. If the show had a good director I suppose the show would have a direction to follow, but this being FranXX, it had to follow all the directions it could and then ended up nowhere. In the first episode I had the show at a shocking 9 and if you look at it now it&#039;s fallen pretty spectacularly. This is because of the show&#039;s bad direction; events were unconnected and an irritated yours truly almost smashed his screen onto the floor . Random stuff happening here with no explanation, and then random stuff happening there without explanation, was this anime devoid of sense or something? Because I did not find any of it anywhere. And then we&#039;ve got the problem that follows that the story was unexplained. Why did this happen? Why did that happen? How did this occur? Where did this issue first occur? There were many questions asked by fans, and the answer is that it was clear both studios didn&#039;t want quality, they wanted the $$$ And that&#039;s me trying to be positive, we got zilch as in reality but eh, gotta act positive. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nNeedless to say, apart from a cliched mess of a story, it&#039;s disappointing in almost every other regard (read on for further explanation), serving as a reminder that it only takes one big mistake to spoil the whole effort put into an anime, or anything for that matter. Speaking of mistakes, we come to another part that had the cosplayers, fan artists and others crazy, the romance\xe2\x80\x94 particularly the romance between Zero Two and Hiro. First off, our two MCs. Zero Two was introduced as a waifu like character which immediately took the undeserving \xe2\x80\x9cdeconstruction\xe2\x80\x9d tag which was ripped off from Eva (surprise surprise, FranXX ripped off a show) while giving us another useless MC who went by the self appointed name Hiro. Their romance was unexplained until way later into the series, an episode which even I liked, episode 13. They were largely unexplained for most of the anime\xe2\x80\x99s run and it was only in the first episode of the second cour (episode 13) that tried to remedy this. Result? Thankfully good. Episode 13 was regarded as an excellent episode by even the harshest of critics since it explained a lot of the stuff between Hiro and Zero Two and obviously it was a flashback episode, yet despite being a flashback episode it was done well\xe2\x80\x94 surprising since this is FranXX. But the problem came afterwards; after that episode was done, we saw a lot of crap follow it in the form of the team getting \xe2\x80\x9cmad\xe2\x80\x9d at Zero Two for \xe2\x80\x9churting\xe2\x80\x9d Hiro for over dramatic effect and to make me sympathise with the characters. Why would you drag through 12 episodes just to see the one episode that seemed half decent and it goes back to its shitty formula? I loathed it even more.The episodes were cliched, unconnected messes with absolutely no relevance to the plot, just serving to pass time either to focus on Hiro or to make the fanboys go crazy over the fight scenes, which were nothing more than one hit kills and random dashes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMoving on from there all we got were cheesy half hearted lines like \xe2\x80\x9cI wanna be with you forever\xe2\x80\x9d and all that teenage fantasy (severely paraphrased for ease of comprehensive analysis) and pointless romantic moments that don&#039;t have much to do with the plot. Why am I crushing the romance here even though I&#039;m a romance fan? It&#039;s because FranXX deployed this romance at the wrong times, I can&#039;t even say I&#039;m surprised anymore at this kind of problem. Then we go to the other cast, Ichigo is a character that served as a reminder about the stupidity of fanboys since her voice actor Kana Ichinose received death threats just because of her work as Ichigo. Anno would be proud. Ichigo\xe2\x80\x99s character though wasn&#039;t fleshed out (to say nothing of the rest of the cast, especially Ikuno, Zorome and Miku) and her actions were basically \xe2\x80\x9cI&#039;m jealous because I love him but can&#039;t reveal it to him because I&#039;m shy\xe2\x80\x9d and that time when she DID do it, it was enough to even send non romance fans into a fit because it was done in a (dare I say it?) slutty way cause teenagers? I do not know. Then we come to the signature part which had many people divided as well, Kokoro. To delve into this horrible character we must enter minor spoiler territory so if you can&#039;t handle looking at a good character being turned into a whore please skip the marked spoiler section. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n***Skip this paragraph if you don&#039;t want spoilers about this side character and want the relationship as a surprise. Spoilers begin: Kokoro was paired up with Futoshi who liked Kokoro a lot but suffered from the same problem as Ichigo. However, since he&#039;s male the fanboys didn&#039;t take or notice much issue, perhaps also because Futoshi wasn&#039;t made as a cockblocker character and instead was of the \xe2\x80\x9cI&#039;ll protect her\xe2\x80\x9d than a \xe2\x80\x9cI want him to love me instead\xe2\x80\x9d, only thing is that Kokoro turned out to \xe2\x80\x9cbetray\xe2\x80\x9d Futoshi and instead go for an unlikely character who was largely ignored throughout the show, Mitsuru. She suddenly developed feelings for him and even kissed him for no concrete reason apart from taking the show into an extremely shitty direction because guess what? She wanted a baby. Why? Freakin\xe2\x80\x99 teenagers\xe2\x80\xa6 this is the worst way to relate to them. Then Kokoro went from a \xe2\x80\x9cI am not in love with Futoshi but he&#039;s a kind person\xe2\x80\x9d to an \xe2\x80\x9cI want Mitsuru\xe2\x80\x99s @#$_ inside me&quot;. I&#039;m not even joking. This LITERALLY happened. Why am I rambling on about this? Because that&#039;s definitely not how you make a show about teenagers because that&#039;s not at all representative of the majority. Anyway, then they suddenly want to get married (!?) and we see other crap follow as well without explanation or reason, they just wanna fill time at this rate. With what? Throwing in the notion that Kokoro is pregnant later on. Teenage pregnancy, a very common thing in teens nowadays amiright? Wrong. And you know what worse? The fact that the folks at FranXX.inc pulled the WORST cliche to go with this. Both of them are caught and are \xe2\x80\x9cbrainwashed\xe2\x80\x9d and their memories are \xe2\x80\x9cstored\xe2\x80\x9d somewhere. If VIRM didn&#039;t want to let them regain their memories then why store them in the first place? Why not \xe2\x80\x9cdelete\xe2\x80\x9d them into oblivion? Plot armour I say. Convenience too\xe2\x80\xa6 this makes many viewers realise that the episode was just existing to pass time and fool the viewers into thinking their time into the episode was worth it?  Spoiler end***<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis brings us on to the next point, underused characters. Namely Miku, Zorome and Ikuno. Not to mention Goro but he got a little bit of a focus so I&#039;ll give him a brief look later. Miku and Zorome were shown as characters who had a rivalry-love which seemed fresh and interesting but that was pulled down along with the anime because they didn&#039;t focus on these two at all. What made them attracted to each other? Why are they paired up together? These questions were never answered and I was left hanging, which was disappointing since Miku apart from sharing the same hairstyle as the superstar with the same name (my profile picture character to those of you non-Vocaloid fans) she was one of the few characters who was believable as a teenager. Many people wouldn&#039;t notice that these two weren&#039;t given enough focus and that was sad because this fresh idea could be explored a lot more and I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if I found their rivalry-love better than the two main characters, and don&#039;t forget, I liked Miku as a character as well. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nLeaving us with the last two, Ikuno and Goro. Ikuno was mainly used as fodder for Mitsuru to frown upon so that he could get hooked to the resident slut Kokoro (I don&#039;t think I should call her that because she didn&#039;t like Futoshi but considered him kind but then I&#039;m disappointed because like Miku, I liked Kokoro, only that love turned to hate since FranXX ruined her) and Ikuno was ignored for the rest of the anime, she wasn&#039;t given lines and that one \xe2\x80\x9cI want a baby\xe2\x80\x9d episode scene where she DID say something, it wasn&#039;t explained WHY she stepped forward and did her act. My guess is because since she didn&#039;t have any lines, the show didn&#039;t want to make her look like a dumbass so they forcefully gave her lines and that was all. Then we enter spoiler territory yet again because Ikuno was given that small 5 minute focus in a later episode. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n***Minor Spoiler Begin: Since Ikuno wasn&#039;t given a love interest the folks at FranXX.inc thought it&#039;s a good idea to introduce some Yuri at the worst possible time and in the worst possible way, as such, the result was never spoken of again, which pretty much explains how the \xe2\x80\x9caffair\xe2\x80\x9d went. Needless to say, this was a last ditch effort to save her character and it served as the final nail in the coffin for Ikuno. Minor Spoiler End*** <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe then come to the last character, Goro. Apart from being mildly explored, he served as the third wheel-ish character who was later shown as being in love with Ichigo unsurprisingly, unfortunately he as mentioned wasn&#039;t explored much and so was thrown into the sidelines to focus on our main characters, yet another character thrown aside who had a lot of potential to do great things in this mess of an anime. I haven&#039;t spoken of any \xe2\x80\x9cvillains\xe2\x80\x9d yet, as this important role was destroyed by the Iotas, who were, like every other thing in the anime, unexplained, unwanted and irrelevant. They served as somewhat of a \xe2\x80\x9cbackstory\xe2\x80\x9d to Zero Two despite not going into detail at all. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs mentioned above there was no proper backstory to Squad 13. Some people said it&#039;s because sci-fi shows \xe2\x80\x9cdon&#039;t need backstories\xe2\x80\x9d. This is plain wrong because if you don&#039;t have backstories of your character, there won&#039;t be any depth to them (see the word depth again and imagine, if there&#039;s no backstory, there&#039;s no depth, which means the characters are shallow) and when the characters simply don&#039;t develop at all during the course of the anime, you end up with flat characters who fall on their face to the plot. Why am I saying this? Hiro and the others didn&#039;t change at all mentally from the first episode to the last. Some might say Hiro\xe2\x80\x99s infatuation with 02 makes him a \xe2\x80\x9cdeveloped character\xe2\x80\x9d but his rejection of his other members in Squad 13 proves that wrong. Others say that \xe2\x80\x9ccharacterisation is excused in a sci-fi anime\xe2\x80\x9d. At first it seemed as a joke to me but when people seriously started talking about this as a defense I got concerned and felt I needed to clarify this. Take arguably the best sci-fi show as an example to that statement: Steins;Gate. It definitely has development throughout the series. How? Okabe starts to realise he can&#039;t do anything, and tries even harder, Makise realises she can&#039;t do things alone, Mayuri does more tuturus because people around her are sad, or to move from the joke, Mayuri realises that she needs Okabe and he needs her, this is what development in a sci-fi is. FranXX, on the other hand, didn&#039;t have any development to the show, its characters, or anything. It felt more like characters felt less real each time they appeared, and I&#039;m not talking about them being realistic and human-like since that&#039;s not what an anime\xe2\x80\x99s main target is everytime, I&#039;m talking about them being acceptable as a character which wasn&#039;t at all seen. No characterisation is only excused in slice of life anime since we&#039;re understandably looking at the lives of the characters and so there&#039;s no plot and therefore no development. FranXX isn&#039;t a slice of life, it&#039;s (terribly weak) progression proved that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMoving back to the MC of our wonderful series, Hiro. I hadn&#039;t given him enough attention and will do so now. From the start he was unexplained. Why was he a prodigy? What was he doing before meeting Zero Two? What made him so special? To stand out from the rest of the cast, you need distinctive qualities that set you apart from other characters, Hiro had none of that. He was plain and boring. Many may point out that him being in love with 02 would mean that it makes him different from other MCs but that&#039;s wrong because apart from his \xe2\x80\x9clove\xe2\x80\x9d for 02, nothing else was brought into his character. Although towards the end it was shown that he had become selfish and cared about 02 more than his squad who cared about him, it still isn&#039;t the kind of development that makes you go \xe2\x80\x9cOh, that changed my view of him positively\xe2\x80\x9d and if you read that line again you&#039;ll probably understand why too. Then we come to the point that he named everyone else, which was revealed early on. This surprisingly is a good thing I saw. He named Ichigo and named other parasites as well which gave it a child-like feeling (perhaps the only successful child-like/teenage feeling that was executed properly throughout the anime, bear in mind this flashback was 2 minutes long) although it wasn&#039;t explained at all I still felt an iota of warmth. And nothing else I suppose.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGoing back to the other \xe2\x80\x9cvillains\xe2\x80\x9d, the Iotas. Since they came in at random times and with random half baked reasons, unsurprisingly they served as yet another thing that was meant to be loathed in the anime. Another irritating thing is how they suddenly became buddy-buddy with Hiro and team in the final arc. I suppose now that FranXX has exhausted whatever little \xe2\x80\x9ccreativity\xe2\x80\x9d they had, they wanted to end with a shounen-esque \xe2\x80\x9ceveryone bands together to fight the enemy\xe2\x80\x9d? I mean, not complaining about the trope but was there any sensible stuff going on beforehand? Speaking of insane stuff going on beforehand, FranXX was said to have been in a post apocalyptic world all of a sudden which we were given hints of in the beach episode for about 20 seconds and then later shown in \xe2\x80\x9cdetail\xe2\x80\x9d (I don&#039;t even know why I&#039;m so generously awarding that word when it&#039;s meaning wasn&#039;t followed at all) in episode 19, which to FranXX\xe2\x80\x99s favour, was a decent episode. But until then for the first 18 episodes, it remained largely unexplained and I don&#039;t think I can award a show a point for revealing something so important when it&#039;s finished about 80% of it&#039;s run. Not a good practice and it returns more harm than good which by now is definitely not what I need to calm myself down. Oh youth. But then wait! Youth reminds me that I should yet again cover another important part about the \xe2\x80\x9cjuvenile\xe2\x80\x9d aspect of this show. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpoiler Paragraph (or Spoiler-graph) for the final arc below. Skip this paragraph if you don&#039;t want spoilers for the final arc. If you&#039;re okay with them, then please continue :)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n***Spoiler for last arc begin: The most frustrating part of FranXX is by far the last arc. After pointless teenage melodrama, the FranXX team thought of what \xe2\x80\x9cideas\xe2\x80\x9d can be added to \xe2\x80\x9csave\xe2\x80\x9d the anime and they did what every laughable show tries to do as a last ditch effort. To take the battle into (wait for it) SPAAAAAACEEEEEE. Yes. FranXX pulled THAT trope. What an insult to Star Wars and Star Trek. Anyway back to this show, the sudden shift in tones (first a teenage melodrama, then a clone war, then a space war? Is this a tutorial on how NOT to make Star Wars ripoffs?) and extremely convenient and unexplained reveals (more on that in a bit) coming out of nowhere? I don&#039;t think that makes for a coherent plot at all. Add to that another desperate added shounen trope where the enemy suddenly becomes your friend??? And he sacrifices his life for you just a while after you rescue him??? The Klaxosaur Princess was set as the antagonist at around the third quarter of the show and she suddenly joined Hiro\xe2\x80\x99s side and sacrificed her life for him? What happened to her people, the Klaxosaurs? What happened to saving the world? And then suddenly VIRM puts themselves as the villains despite the show trying to establish the Klaxosaurs as the villains and then the aforementioned Klaxosaur Princess as an antagonist? And then their boss is a Power Rangers ripoff??? What even was that last arc?! The industry can do without more Dadolf Scmitlers you know! We&#039;ve seen enough of this trope! Like when they&#039;re losing Papa and the others suddenly give the order to destroy Earth? Nanja sorya??? And then if you thought all this stupidity wasn&#039;t enough, we suddenly see YET ANOTHER problem with the show surface, Plot armour. If I hadn&#039;t explained this before, FranXX suffered from yet another plot hole in the form of plot armour. The Iotas lost a few of their members but Hiro and team were left unscathed, the only \xe2\x80\x9cinjury\xe2\x80\x9d being Ikuno\xe2\x80\x99s hair being turned white\xe2\x80\xa6 Throughout the course of the show Squad 13 was met with life or death situations but I was confused since no one died. It can&#039;t be a life or death situation if everyone survives, or at least when you have so many life or death situations and no one dies even once I think that&#039;s authentically bullshit. Why fill it to the brim with Deus Ex Machina crap then? In the last 3 episodes we saw Hiro and team suddenly band together and go to space, but then the pathetic dialogue in the previous episodes of the anime became even worse, when they&#039;re in space they&#039;re going \xe2\x80\x9cWe&#039;re really in space huh?\xe2\x80\x9d And Mitsuru\xe2\x80\x99s reason for staying being \xe2\x80\x9cI wanna stay because I want to\xe2\x80\x9d? Even the dialogues took a huge hit and fell even further\xe2\x80\xa6 Add to that the pointless Mobile Suit Gundam I ripoff battle except FranXX\xe2\x80\x99s was much worse because everyone survived??? Not to mention Zero Two eating Hiro through her teleport to Hiro fro Earth directly in front of Hiro and she eats him and takes him to the dream world only to play hard to get? If you&#039;re not understanding at all then you have common sense, because no sensible person could understand WHAT happened and WHY. Let&#039;s not add to that horrible reasons to horrible dialogues such as bringing up love when your Squadmate is suffering? And then Hiro and Zero Two immediately go leave the Solar System and the others can&#039;t tag along because \xe2\x80\x9cit&#039;s not possible\xe2\x80\x9d? This is the limit of cliches but the studios broke it long long ago. And I want to skip over that last episode since that was the only (remotely) decent (?) part of this arc, but the means done to achieve it wasn&#039;t and I spoke enough on that... Spoiler end***<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFranXX tries to show us that adults are somewhat tyrants and displays the children\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstruggle\xe2\x80\x9d to gaining \xe2\x80\x9cindependence\xe2\x80\x9d even though they&#039;re perfectly fine with their lives with no issues. But you know what they say, if you&#039;ve got no issues, you make them, and that&#039;s EXACTLY what FranXX stayed true to. Trying to show us that our teenage cast is \xe2\x80\x9cgrowing\xe2\x80\x9d by acting \xe2\x80\x9cmature\xe2\x80\x9d with examples as \xe2\x80\x9c wanting to have babies\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdoing the kitty\xe2\x80\x9d (don&#039;t search up on that last one) both of which are related and were attempted by Kokoro and Mitsuru. Yet again you ask. Why? I do not know why the show did it. You can&#039;t even tell anymore who they&#039;re trying to make the show relatable for. Then we have to look at the teenage drama as well that follows (that I covered above). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpoiler Paragraph (or Spoiler-graph) about a range of questions on things that were unanswered throughout the course of the anime below. Skip this paragraph if you don&#039;t want spoilers on these questions. If you&#039;re okay with them, then as expected, read on.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n***Spoiler questions begin: FranXX as mentioned tried very very hard to be edgy by leaving out some so-called \xe2\x80\x9cmystery\xe2\x80\x9d feel by not answering the most crucial questions many had throughout the course of the anime. Although episode 13 answered the questions many people had in the first half, there was no such plausible explanation for the second half\xe2\x80\x99s stupidity. What makes me say that? We got weak explanations or no explanations. For example why was the enemy VIRM all along? What was their purpose? Why does Hiro not care about the rest of Squad 13 who he&#039;s lived with all his life and why is he so attached to Zero Two despite the above problem? Why are the problems for the characters happening? Who is to blame and why? Despite this being answered (VIRM) there was no proper explanation as to WHY the villains did it? What was their purpose? Why is Ichigo the leader of the group? Why is 02 not explained properly? How does she looks human and how did it happen (also why does she have pink hair when she was a clone of one with white or blue hair)? How are the rejected people treated? What happens to them? What about their memories? Although their memories as mentioned were stored in some place there&#039;s no explanation as to why they&#039;re stored. Why am I asking that question? When VIRM doesn&#039;t want their puppets to regain their memory, why store their memory? And how is the memory stored anyway? Why are teens chosen to pilot the FranXX? Don&#039;t tell me it&#039;s because their sex organs are most prominent because the teenage years is not the age when this is so. Why are pregnant girls not able to pilot the FranXX? How did the Iotas suddenly be able to join Hiro in the last arc? Weren&#039;t they broken or something? Why do Hiro\xe2\x80\x99s group care and still chase Hiro despite him having rejected them for his \xe2\x80\x9cone true love\xe2\x80\x9d Zero Two? What was the bullcrap about them going to space and space being the important stuff? Like, what was that cop out explanation about VIRM and the enemies being the aliens? Who and what was the Klaxosaur Princess? Who were the Klaxosaurs? No detailed explanations were given. To cover the villains one last time, VIRM. We look again at the Dadolf Scmitler trope that FranXX.inc deployed. To viewers of Grancrest Senki who aren&#039;t familiar with the Dadolf Scmitler trope, VIRM is basically the Mage Academy, for the first 20 Episodes we were focused on only one villain but suddenly that villain changes in around the 20th episode and they tell us the real villains were someone else all along? (Surprising how both shows deploy the same cliche in the same episode number. Coincidence? I think not), Why is this bad? This is bad because it makes the viewer question if the time they spent on the first 20 episodes even worth it. I mean, if you really HAD to do this, why do it so late? And instead, why not just make an OVA of the last 6-8 episodes and treat it as the same thing? I&#039;m sure it would get a higher score from me and other disgruntled people if they did this instead because our time was wasted\xe2\x80\xa6 Spoiler questions end***<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith all that&#039;s said, eagle eyed readers might have noticed that I haven&#039;t trashed the art or the music. That&#039;s because it isn&#039;t shit. And continue to find out. Since it was a collaboration project with A-1 and Trigger (and later Cloverworks because budget issues?) many expected the art to look amazing and it did actually. They tried to make a world that looked beautiful and mostly succeeded in doing that but you can&#039;t award points to a show for \xe2\x80\x9clooking good\xe2\x80\x9d as with what the \xe2\x80\x9cmainstream\xe2\x80\x9d gaming critics like IGN often do (\xe2\x80\x9cCoD a 9/10 because it looks good?\xe2\x80\x9d Have you even seen what they&#039;re doing now ripping off Fortnite?) so though the art looked good thanks to the colourful backgrounds and eye-catching scenery from time to time, it was in vain as the show couldn&#039;t manage to utilise it well into its plot. Another thing that the show did good was the sound. Even though I&#039;ve been (rightfully) trashing the show left and right, I have to give credit where it&#039;s due, FranXX\xe2\x80\x99s usage of synth tracks are rarely seen in anime and obviously serve for something really good in terms of listening especially when you&#039;re using headphones (and not streaming the show). Then we move onto the OP/EDs selection, I felt that the show went lazy and just changed the OP a bit and passed it off as an OP 2, but the EDs were great. If only FranXX used those EDs more in the second half and don&#039;t abruptly end the episode I&#039;d have a positive opinion of the show. But I&#039;m guilty of singing \xe2\x80\x9cTorikago\xe2\x80\x9d from the show so gotta give a point to that I guess? But oh wait, they underused all the EDs anyway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverall, FranXX is a mess which was over hyped and tried it&#039;s best to stay relevant by throwing in useless storylines all of which were riddled by plot holes and Deus ex machinas which were unconnected and not to mention completely unrelated events and random crap here and there (from teenage drama to Star Wars to Power Rangers? MASAKA???), to remain positive, towards the end, I only ever found the two caretakers Hachi and Nana (especially Nana) interesting and likeable since they had an aura of mystery and the 30 seconds they appeared in their few episodes were all great. Miku and Goro too were characters I pretty much liked but weren&#039;t explored well since they were thrown aside for Hiro and Zero Two unfortunately. If the show had good direction, I&#039;m sure it would have turned out to be one of my favourite anime of all time and for many other disillusioned fans-turned-critics as well. FranXX sadly will always serve as a reminder to how one big mistake in the form of bad directing can jeopardize the whole premise of a show.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpecial thanks to TheCobraSlayer for proof-reading the review.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStory: 0.5<br />\r\nAnimation: 5<br />\r\nSound: 5.5<br />\r\nCharacter: 1<br />\r\nEnjoyment: 1.5<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverall: 2.7\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_283195" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-283195">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Fanime%2F35849%2FDarling_in_the_FranXX" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle283195"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="283195">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=283195" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=283195" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right; text-align: right;">\n      <div title="8:10 AM">Jul 7, 2018</div>\n      <div class="lightLink spaceit">\n                  24 of 24 episodes seen\n              </div>\n      <div>\n        <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$(\'#score283200\').toggle()">Overall Rating</a>:\n        1\n      </div>\n    </div><div style="float: left;">\n      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">\n        <tr>\n                                              <td valign="top" width="60">\n              <div class="picSurround">\n                <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/RebelPanda">\n                  <img src="https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/userimages/thumbs/4150781_thumb.jpg" data-src="https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/userimages/thumbs/4150781_thumb.jpg" border="0" class=" lazyloaded">\n                </a>\n              </div>\n            </td>\n                    <td valign="top">\n                          <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/RebelPanda">RebelPanda</a>\n              <small>(<a href="/profile/RebelPanda/reviews">All reviews</a>)</small><br>\n                        <div class="lightLink spaceit">\n              <strong>\n                <span id="rhelp283200">400</span>\n              </strong>\n              people found this review helpful\n            </div>\n                      </td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class="spaceit textReadability word-break pt8 mt8" style="clear: both; border-top: 1px solid #ebebeb;">\n        <div style="float: left; display: none; margin: 0 10px 10px 0" id="score283200">\n      <table border="0" width="105" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="borderClass" style="border-width: 1px;">\n        <tr>\n          <td class="borderClass bgColor1"><strong>Overall</strong></td>\n          <td class="borderClass bgColor1"><strong>1</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td class="borderClass" align="left">Story</td>\n          <td class="borderClass">0</td>\n        </tr>\n                  <tr>\n            <td class="borderClass" align="left">Animation</td>\n            <td class="borderClass">3</td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td class="borderClass" align="left">Sound</td>\n            <td class="borderClass">3</td>\n          </tr>\n                <tr>\n          <td class="borderClass" align="left">Character</td>\n          <td class="borderClass">0</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td class="borderClass" style="border-width: 0;" align="left">Enjoyment</td>\n          <td class="borderClass" style="border-width: 0;">0</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n    </div>\n\n                          \n    For decades, glorious Nippon has been growing closer to extinction.

Spoiler-free TL;DR at the end.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the declining birthrate in Japan, people are living longer, but fewer babies are being born; there aren\xe2\x80\x99t enough young people to take care of the elderly. The Japanese government is spending more money on health care, the workforce is shrinking with less\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review283200">\n        young people to fill jobs, people are often being overworked due to a lack of employees, the economy isn\xe2\x80\x99t flowing properly. The country\xe2\x80\x99s issues become abundantly clear when looking at how pharmacies stock their shelves with more diapers for adults than for kids.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThen there\xe2\x80\x99s Darling in the Franxx, a shoddily written clusterfuck of a mecha series that attempts to inform it&#039;s audience about Japan\xe2\x80\x99s declining birthrate. Yet when it does address the issue of birthrate, it only manages to conjure the most asinine, idiotic, and offensive answers possible. While it\xe2\x80\x99s animation, storyboarding, and fight choreography are exceptional for at least half of the show, it\xe2\x80\x99s writing fails on every conceivable level. Beginning as a subpar and predictable character-driven drama with a vague sci-fi setting, it gradually fell into incoherence and the lack of information was a trick used to mask the nonsensical lore.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPart 1: [Hiro &amp; Zero Two]<br />\r\nThe first indication that something horribly wrong with A-1 Pictures/Trigger\xe2\x80\x99s dystopian mecha series Darling in the Franxx appears in the first scene of episode one; a monologue by the monotonous protagonist Hiro and his soon to be wild waifu Zero Two.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Jian, also known as the bird that shares wings, only possesses one wing. Unless a male and female pair lean on each other and act as one, they\xe2\x80\x99re incapable of flight.\xe2\x80\x9d<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis metaphor is symbolized throughout the series, it can be found on the characters\xe2\x80\x99 uniforms and on the futuristic infrastructure, yet there is no such thing as a \xe2\x80\x98Jian\xe2\x80\x99 bird in real nature. There is no species of bird that only has one wing, even implying a bird like that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t die out through natural selection is ridiculous. This metaphor has two meanings; the literal: the mechas the kids pilot known as Franxx cannot fly without a male-female pair, as the series demonstrated in Partner Shuffle when two girls were explicitly unable to pilot together (ep. 11). The theme applicable to the audience: that every human has a physical for need another person of the opposite sex, throughout the show we see the characters experience this. Franxx mistakes relying on another human for survival as love, it\xe2\x80\x99s not. That\xe2\x80\x99s just codependency. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nNever does the show attempt to refute the message that codependency is necessary for survival, it only romanticizes toxicity by building Hiro and Zero Two\xe2\x80\x99s relationship on nothing but things they need from each other, never actual love. He needs her because he has no one else he can pilot with, she needs him because he\xe2\x80\x99s the first partner she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t killed. Any struggles they face are caused by plot contrivances pulling them apart then putting them back together with fanfare to trick you into thinking they actually overcame something. Yet, they\xe2\x80\x99re framed as the happiest and most exemplary couple in the series. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t love, it\xe2\x80\x99s fucking codependency! They both NEED something from one another and that\xe2\x80\x99s what is tying them together, not a bond! They\xe2\x80\x99re like two snakes wrapping around each other until one of them suffocates first. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the beginning of the series, Hiro is wallowing in self-pity because he was just too good for his last piloting partner, she was a lame normal girl and the show decides he needs a wilder girl. He\xe2\x80\x99s just a potato self-insert protagonist, everyone loves him for reasons that aren\xe2\x80\x99t nearly compelling enough to the viewer. Seeing all of the characters in love with or admire Hiro feels so unnatural, it\xe2\x80\x99s so obvious that they\xe2\x80\x99re deliberately written to like him regardless of how little charisma he has. All of Hiro\xe2\x80\x99s struggles are rooted in him being better than everyone else. He just perceives himself as being worse because of his frustratingly low self-confidence. The show reminds us of this at every chance it gets with self-pitying inner monologues, but no matter how much he annoys us he never gets anywhere near believability.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce his wild waifu Zero Two shows up and they start piloting with one another, he finally feels fulfilled. She\xe2\x80\x99s a half monster half human hybrid and she has horns. That&#039;s the single flimsy explanation we get for her craziness, not nearly enough to find her personality believable, but at least she didn&#039;t have the same generic design as all of the other characters. She\xe2\x80\x99s known as the \xe2\x80\x98partner killer\xe2\x80\x99 because anyone who pilots with her dies after three times, keep in mind this was back when she was allowed to have interesting character traits. This conflict gave the show chance to discuss how Hiro felt physical pain when he piloted with her, but as we would come to see, the show had no interest in delving into its characters in any meaningful way. Zero Two spends the first half of the show wallowing in angst because she\xe2\x80\x99s not a human or whatever, which is moderately intriguing because she develops PTSD and in hallucinations sees the past partners she killed. It gave the show a chance to actually develop her in a meaningful way, but this was dropped entirely for the sake of making her relationship with Hiro seem as saccharine as possible. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Beast and the Prince (ep.13), their backstory episode more or less existed solely to contribute to the cloying tone. Zero Two began as a test subject for the creator of the partner piloting system Dr. Franxx himself, and he\xe2\x80\x99s a really evil guy so the episode spends a fair bit of time on her being tortured. Genericness and predictability aside, the episode itself is decent enough upon first inspection; Hiro became friends with Zero two as a kid while in training, he taught her what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to be a normal kid, they tried to escape Dr. Franxx together but were eventually caught, and then their memories of each other were erased. I personally didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for the episode considering it was more or less a copy of a climactic scene from Yuri Kuma Arashi; it directly ripped storyboards, narrative beats, but it had none of the thematic implications. Franxx copies so many great anime like this to craft a hackneyed story that\xe2\x80\x99s less interesting than even one of its parts. The only reason anyone will have to remember this anime is for the climactic moments, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t give it any credit for those knowing how much worse it is than the material it plagiarized. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe travesty that was Punishment and Confessions (ep.14) was the turning point in the series when it lost any chance to develop the two leads beyond their one-dimensional starting point. In this episode, Hiro\xe2\x80\x99s squad separate him and Zero Two because their last time piloting together left him in critical condition with her simply remarking something like \xe2\x80\x98if he can\xe2\x80\x99t handle it then he\xe2\x80\x99s not worth it.\xe2\x80\x99 Hiro\xe2\x80\x99s squad, in spite of being mostly cardboard-cutout non-characters, are always in the right when they call out Hiro for his bullshit. The major cause of conflict between them is when Zero Two goes to visit Hiro but when she arrives at the infirmary, by some coincidence Hiro happened to have snuck out of the room and went looking for her. When she noticed he was missing, she went into psycho girlfriend mode and tried to murder his friends to find him. Then through another coincidence Hiro returned and see this brawl, convincing him to break off their relationship. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t a conflict that arises due to their difference in personalities, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fucking lazy ass plot contrivance. It only existed for them to be able to have a reunion a single episode later and act like they actually overcame something, they did not learn ANYTHING from this. Hiro and his friends all forgive Zero Two with no discussion whatsoever in the next goddamn episode, no apologies for her beating the crap out of all of them. The show treats this like the grandest climax so far; for the last time in Trigger&#039;s fantastic sakuga is on display, then it\xe2\x80\x99s pure mediocrity for the following nine episodes. Their reunion had virtually no impact narratively because it contradicted what we just saw in the previous episode and it nullified all of Zero Two\xe2\x80\x99s emotional baggage. After episode 15 the whole partner killer thing is forgotten, her PTSD is not discussed again, her being half monster is barely an afterthought, all because somehow being in a codependent relationship helped her. After episode 15 they were still very much relying on one another to survive, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t develop in an organic way. Eventually, their parasitic relationship led to Zero Two sacrificing herself, becoming a rock and also turning into a giant space robot lady.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the beginning, Zero Two was the most interesting character in the series; she was defined by her unpredictability, she had intriguing emotional hang-ups, she had potential to be a good character. Then by the end, she became a rock, both in physically and metaphorically. She lost any edge she had because her wildness was tamed by Hiro. As we see throughout the series this is the case with all of the pairings, their relationships stunt character growth. For the rest of the show, Zero Two had no agency over the story other than sacrificing herself for her darling&#039;s sake. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPart 2: [Story &amp; Setting]<br />\r\nIn the early episodes of Franxx, little emphasis is put on the setting, it\xe2\x80\x99s purposefully left vague for the majority of the show. Post-apocalyptic Earth is mostly deserts, a council of powerful adults issue orders to the various squads of kids to protect the plantations containing adults unfit for battle. Kids pilot mechas to destroy oncoming attacks from giant alien creatures known as Klaxosaurs. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat began as a standard, but functional premise, rapidly descended into nonsense. With each big reveal and twist the show gradually lost what the main story was even about. At the start of the series the creatures the kids fight are aliens, then it\xe2\x80\x99s revealed to be an older form of humans, then it\xe2\x80\x99s revealed the council of adults were the real aliens all along, because why the fuck not. Then it\xe2\x80\x99s revealed that all of the adults are immortal because they injected molten lava into themselves. There are so many conflicting pieces in the lore of Franxx, it&#039;s total illogical nonsense. The best way to look at the writing in Franxx is from a thematic perspective because that\xe2\x80\x99s all the show seems to care about.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRather than competently crafting a story Franxx puts more emphasis on is its characters, themes, emotions. Similar to the mecha classics that it copies incessantly, like Evangelion and Gunbuster, this is an emotional narrative. Except, they don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to make characters feel like believable humans and the themes attempt social commentary without actually commenting on person/group of people that exist in the real world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story progresses in a semi-episodic structure similar to Evangelion, episodes typically do not pick up right where the previous ones leave off plot-wise. Instead, they follow the squad of the ten main characters as they experience becoming pilots and overcoming drama amongst one another, all while delivering small details on the setting to keep you intrigued to where it may go. If Franxx were actually good, this plot structure could work just as well as the shows it\xe2\x80\x99s imitating, but it\xe2\x80\x99s so much worse. Despite being relatively well animated, its story beats are mind-numbingly generic and it almost never surprises. It feels like the script was generated by a soulless corporation, ticking off a checklist with each generic story beat, cliched character archetype, and seemingly important themes used cheaply as window dressing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile watching Franxx, you are always ten steps ahead of the characters. They\xe2\x80\x99re shocked by the most mundane tropes found in any sci-fi dystopian stories. Like when the main cast discovers they aren\xe2\x80\x99t the first squad of kids who lived in their dormitory, it was information hinted at us many times over with the kids constantly saying \xe2\x80\x9coh I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to be an adult someday\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Wow, what a shocker, the menacing council of enigmatic hooded figures leading an army of child soldiers are actually evil. Who could have guessed?? Apparently none of the characters. This is an issue all throughout the series, the story beats are so standard yet the show feels the need to present it with arbitrary foreshadowing as if it\xe2\x80\x99s not obvious enough already. Franxx is the kind of series that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s audience is capable of thinking beyond the level of a toddler, so at every chance it gets it spoon-feeds us information, making it even more unbearable to watch. Expecting us to be brain dead idiots or very young children is also what lead Franxx to create some of the most hilariously stupid metaphors in anime.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe mechas and how the kids pilot them are very obnoxiously a metaphor for sex; the boy mounting the girl in a doggy style position, complete with sex terminology to describe the mechas and seating positions. As if it the sex analogy wasn\xe2\x80\x99t clear enough, the characters\xe2\x80\x99 piloting banter always sounds like they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about sex rather than I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, fighting aliens. The mechas themselves are for some unexplained reason female, with over-sexualized features so there is always fanservice right in the middle of fight scenes to distract you from the action. They&#039;re a mishmash of ugly colors and random accessories that make no sense, the designs are hideous desperately trying to look attractive. And the thing is, the kids have been raised in a sterile environment devoid of any information about sexuality, so they don\xe2\x80\x99t even know how perverted the act of piloting is. First of all, that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of creepy and only adds to the layer of sleazy fanservice covering this whole mess, secondly, it presents the themes of procreation in such a painstakingly literal way that there is no room for analysis. If Franxx had even a little self-awareness, this tonal whiplash could have been at least partially avoided if it were framed as humorous, instead, it\xe2\x80\x99s unknowingly parodying itself by being as stupid as possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat leads us to the fact that the world of Darling in the Franxx makes no goddamn sense. It\xe2\x80\x99s full of contradictions. We\xe2\x80\x99re constantly told that the kids don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about sexuality, they don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what a kiss is, yet they for some reason they view nudity as inherently sexual. Clearly, the writers did not consider what a culture would look like if boys and girls are raised alongside each other without any real contact with adults or exposure to sex. The boys \xe2\x80\x98ogle\xe2\x80\x99 the girls pervertedly which makes no fucking sense because they should not know to view them as sexual, and the fact that the girls feel shame, in turn, makes no sense either. If the show hadn\xe2\x80\x99t forced that pointless beach episode in, these issues wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been as noticeable. In a better written dystopian story, the character\xe2\x80\x99s puberty would be free of expectations that would typically be passed on to them by society. However rather than carefully considering the dynamics of the sci-fi setting they were attempting to create, the writers simply give us standard romance cliches and romcom hijinks seen in any generic anime.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPart 3 [WHAT THE FUCK IS FRANXX EVEN ABOUT?]<br />\r\nThe world building in Darling in the Franxx is flat out awful, which is what makes the vast majority of the story feel incredibly shapeless. It takes 17 episodes for Franxx to actually clarify what the hell it is actually commenting on in the real world. If Franxx wanted to be a good reflection the birthrate decline in Japan it would have had to actually make use of its sci-fi setting beyond just stupid sex-powered mechas. For starters, a lack of kids being born would be an explicit conflict in the story to reflect the birth rate decline in modern day Japan. However, there are a TON of children in Franxx! So many that they are able to throw them into cryosleep as we see in episode 22. There is a surplus of kids in Franxx if discussing birth-rate was the real goal of the show then they failed from the start. The issues the heroes in Darling in the Franxx face is not that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t enough children. They want to have children the normal way with the boy-girl pairs they were assigned to, but the aliens in control of their system do not allow that. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEpisode 17 is the moment that the series lays down its themes clearer than it ever had before. Kokoro voices that she wants to have a baby in order to feel fulfilled, then the evil Squad Nine comes and takes her book on pregnancy and they tell her humans have cast away their reproductive organs because they cause too much unnecessary drama. He further clarifies by stating the firm belief of APE, the council of aliens leading the anti-reproduction regime. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is simply connecting a person&#039;s fertility directly to their emotional depth. The world of Franxx says you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to reproduce OR have emotion, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the main characters are trying to break away from. Of course, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they want to break out of a system like that? But why? What does it represent? What person or group in the real world is preventing people from having kids because they want to be shallow, genderless, and without children? No one! It&#039;s social commentary written by someone who is out of touch with reality. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the awful backstory of \xe2\x80\x9cInhumanity\xe2\x80\x9d (ep.19), Dr. Franxx voices that he believes humans are only truly beautiful if they can procreate, which is why he puts faith in Hiro\xe2\x80\x99s squad to become \xe2\x80\x9creal humans\xe2\x80\x9d and create children in his designated forced piloting system. The piloting is just pseudo-science that very obviously has no reason for existing outside of serving the show\xe2\x80\x99s message and trashy fan service. The show takes this message even further by portraying any person or group who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t procreate the Franxx way as a threat to humanity. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFranxx is very much able to say a traditional family is good; mother, father, procreating, that is a good message for tackling birthrate. But for some reason, it chooses to frame anyone who chooses not to adhere to the traditionalist family setup as a threat to mankind. Franxx just ignores the fact that there are many other ways people can have a family, and still live fulfilled lives. There can be same-sex relationships, people can adopt kids, or even to not have children at all, but Franxx says these are all signs of inhumanity. That hilariously stupid wedding episode served only to convey this message but in the most hamfisted way possible. In episode 18, the alien SWAT team led by APE literally raids the makeshift wedding between Kokoro and Mitsuru. They tear the bride and groom apart, then erasing their memories of one another.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe entire wedding arc was unnecessary to the story and boring as hell, it was just crammed in there for the sake of pushing these themes even more. APE is just the idea of diversity but overblown to ridiculous proportions. It antagonizes anyone who opposes traditionalism to an absurd degree, but it also portrays traditionalists as insanely hysterical in their beliefs in an offensively stereotypical way. Both sides of the political spectrum are written in a way that is so overblown to an alienating degree that very few people will want to agree with it. When the purpose of a piece of art is to change the audience&#039;s political views, it is fitting to label it as propaganda. However, assuming that level of thought and consideration was put into the story would be giving the moron who wrote it way too much credit. Regardless of your stance on the themes in Franxx, this is all it has to offer in terms of in-depth analysis, other than that it&#039;s boring teenage drama between underdeveloped characters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPart 4: [The Squad]<br />\r\nHow could this have happened?! The voice actors were good enough to mask a lack of depth, the animators were talented enough to make them look like lively pieces of cardboard (at least in the first half), but nope instead they are unavoidably awful and no icing will make this pile of shit resemble a cake. At best they\xe2\x80\x99re forgettable, but at worst they\xe2\x80\x99re horribly portrayed archetypes that will make you feel sorry for how badly the show treats them. There was so much potential in most of these characters, but without writers capable of crafting cohesive or satisfying arcs, all of them remain flat cardboard cutouts only existing to support Hiro and Zero Two\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to be the most obnoxious couple in the show. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIchigo:<br />\r\nAll this poor girl did was have a crush on the potato protagonist, and that caused people to send her voice actress death threats. They\xe2\x80\x99re fucking children, who gives a shit about who likes who? Her reason for actually liking him is so vague and petty, they were friends as children. And per Franxx\xe2\x80\x99s idiot logic, your first affectionate interaction with a person will decide who you\xe2\x80\x99re attracted to when you&#039;re older. Ichigo had a few interesting moments of standing up to Zero Two for the sake of protecting Hiro, it of course went how you expect, with the two parasites wallowing in codependency and nothing developing. She does very little throughout the show aside from looking pouty whenever she sees the two leads acting lovey-dovey around her. It was impossible for me to sympathize with her because I can\xe2\x80\x99t comprehend why she would feel so strongly towards a potato. Regardless of her love, by the end, she does not change at all despite being the most prominent supporting character. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGoro:<br />\r\nOccasionally Goro calls Hiro out on his bullshit in some of the most satisfying scenes of the series, then in the most disappointing moments of the series, he immediately apologizes and acknowledges Hiro\xe2\x80\x99s superiority. Goro is allowed to be a character for a few seconds once every few episodes, but for the remainder of the show, he has no stakes in the story. <br />\r\nGoro\xe2\x80\x99s main attribute is that he\xe2\x80\x99s a nice guy who feels unrequited love for Ichigo. He respects her and acknowledges that she has feelings for Hiro and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t overstep his boundaries. He\xe2\x80\x99s the most likable member of the whole cast, but sadly there is literally nothing to him than his unrequited love for Ichigo. His whole character arc culminates very early on in \xe2\x80\x9cTriangle Bomb\xe2\x80\x9d (ep. 9) when he confesses his love to Ichigo in the best way he could, explicitly stating he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to pressure her but wanted to clear the tension between them because he is a nice and respectful guy. <br />\r\nThen Ichigo shrugs off his confession with \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to respond to that,\xe2\x80\x9d<br />\r\n... <br />\r\n...and then she literally doesn\xe2\x80\x99t...<br />\r\n...<br />\r\nFOR THE ENTIRE SHOW.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKokoro:<br />\r\nOk, I was bracing myself by talking about Goro first because Kokoro is by far the worst member of the squad. Not only is she the source of many plot holes, she is more or less a vehicle for the show\xe2\x80\x99s creator to preach the themes. In the totally 100% necessary beach episode (ep.7), she finds her bible, a book on pregnancy, and for the remainder of the series, she preaches it like scripture. She uses it to learn about sexuality, weddings, and childbirth. In \xe2\x80\x9cBoys x Girls\xe2\x80\x9d (ep.8) she references the book to explain why the boys were ogling the girls, she says \xe2\x80\x98we have to put up with their perviness in order to pilot together and to eventually have a family with them.\xe2\x80\x99 Kokoro believes that girls are supposed to ignore any problems they have with the boys because they have to make a baby regardless of how they feel. Not only is this a harmful message for viewers, it also causes even more stagnant character writing because the pilot pairings never have discussions about their troubles. Nothing is ever overcome because Kokoro perpetuates this outdated rhetoric. <br />\r\n  <br />\r\nKokoro does very little throughout the show, mostly sitting passively until she gets the baby craziness and demands to be allowed to have a child. After promising she would stay with her piloting partner Futoshi, she immediately kicks him to the curb for a new guy in episode 11 for no other reason than he\xe2\x80\x99s fat and she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want her kid to have the fat genes. So needless to say she\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a monster and I felt no sympathy whatsoever. <br />\r\nThat leads us to the makeshift wedding they come up with which was one of the stupidest moments in the show; for some reason, right before she is wed to Mitsuru they\xe2\x80\x99re raided by APE with their SWAT team. It\xe2\x80\x99s totally ridiculous to think that a futuristic advanced society of aliens could kick down the door at any moment, but they chose to wait just as the two are about to kiss. And seeing them waving around guns at a wedding full of kids is so unbelievably over-the-top. That whole marriage episode was a trudge to get through, and I was honestly relieved when the alien SWAT reproduction-abolitionists ended it early. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut wait, there\xe2\x80\x99s more. APE erases Kokoro and Mitsuru\xe2\x80\x99s memories one another, but this opens even more plot holes:<br />\r\n1. APE forgot to remove their wedding rings after the memory removal procedure, genius.<br />\r\n2. All of the other kids knew about the memories getting erased so they just told her and that\xe2\x80\x99s how she remembered. <br />\r\n3. She was still pregnant after being captured by the anti-marriage alien SWAT team. They\xe2\x80\x99re pretty bad at being an anti-reproduction regime if they can\xe2\x80\x99t even figure out this basic shit.<br />\r\n4. Kokoro and Mitsuru regain their memories a few episodes later on their own, they overcome literally nothing because they return to how they were just before getting married. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nZorome/Miku:<br />\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re the most forgettable members of the squad, simple one-note personalities with no impact on the story. They do have a brief bit of \xe2\x80\x98development\xe2\x80\x99 if you can even call it that abhorrent in \xe2\x80\x9cBoys x Girls\xe2\x80\x9d (ep. 8). They clash briefly when Zorome ogles Miku (we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed how this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense) and she reacts by dividing the dormitory with tape in the most sitcom-y episode in the show. For a mecha series that tries to take itself seriously, throwing a proverbial wrench in the tone does not make the characters seem more human and relatable, it was such an unnatural tonal shift that it made them feel like aliens. Other than this one fanservice episode, they just hang around the squad and offer a few inconsequential reactions and quips that add absolutely nothing to the show but background noise. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFutoshi: <br />\r\nThis poor chubby kid is just bullied by the show whenever he is onscreen, his whole character arc is one big fat joke. At first, it was just a few offbeat jokes along the lines of \xe2\x80\x9cHey, don\xe2\x80\x99t take any of my food while I\xe2\x80\x99m gone.\xe2\x80\x9d His humor was just as unnatural and stereotypical as the rest of the cast, but then the show takes it a step further from a poorly written annoyance into offensively awful. His piloting partner Kokoro ditches him during \xe2\x80\x9cPartner Shuffle\xe2\x80\x9d because he has the fat genes and she wants a good baby to further the species. Understandably, this causes him to become insecure about his weight and form an eating disorder. This is a very sensitive topic with plenty of potential for good discussion, but this is Franxx so they flushed any potential down the toilet. Franxx approaches this real-world issue that affects plenty of people with the sensitivity of a sledgehammer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe writers were too incompetent to deftly handle a serious topic like an eating disorder, so instead they literally just ignore it. Most of episode 16 is dedicated to his struggling with not wanting to eat any food, with Zorome confirming that Futoshi is throwing up his food. Yet even though they confront him about his insecurity, the episode ends with Hiro giving one of his bullshit speeches about friendship with sad piano music playing, cue the whole cast crying. Futoshi\xe2\x80\x99s turmoil was glossed over and never resolved, likely because none of the corporate drones that manufactured this knew how to sensitively handle real-world issues. The director goes out of his way to show us how unhappy he is with himself in minor ways throughout the rest of the show. Whether he be playing with his food or sadly staring down at his full plate, even by the end it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious he\xe2\x80\x99s still struggling with his disorder yet Franxx couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give less of a shit about his turmoil. Rather than addressing his issue, they choose to force him to be the de facto-priest at Kokoro\xe2\x80\x99s wedding, it\xe2\x80\x99s so cruel and horrible that I might actually have felt bad for him if he had actual character traits beyond \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s fat lol.\xe2\x80\x9d<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIkuno:<br />\r\nThroughout the show, she is very blatantly hinted at being in love with Ichigo, which gave the show a huge chance to backtrack on the message that anyone who isn\xe2\x80\x99t in a heterosexual relationship is actively part of the birthrate problem. But because Franxx is the anime of disappointments, her character arc was handled appallingly. One of the most egregious moments in the series was in &quot;When the Sakura Blooms&quot; (ep. 18) when Ikuno confesses her love to Ichigo and she wrote it off by saying \xe2\x80\x9coh I was the same when I felt unrequited love for Hiro, but now I am doing what&#039;s necessary for the greater good and hooking up with someone else.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s the passive-aggressive type of homophobia I&#039;ve seen plenty of in real life from people who are only accepting of gay people as long as they become straight eventually. What Ichigo says to Ikuno sounds more like \xe2\x80\x98oh how sad that you\xe2\x80\x99re defective, someday you\xe2\x80\x99ll grow out of that phase.\xe2\x80\x99 <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t end there, Ikuno is perpetually shown as the least able member of the squad. Like I mentioned previously, this show dives into some dark dehumanizing themes of eugenics. It is explicitly stated that in the world of Franxx, your life force is directly connected to your fertility, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not having a kid your hair will become gray and you will die faster than those who chose to further the species. Whether or not it was the creator\xe2\x80\x99s intention to dehumanize LGBT people, he threw these pieces on the board and they landed unnervingly close to hate-speech.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMitsuru:<br />\r\nAt the start of the series, Mitsuru is the \xe2\x80\x98rival\xe2\x80\x99 archetype who has an inferiority complex to Hiro, but through subtle coding is indicated to actually be in love with him. Mitsuru received his name from Hiro when he was a child, therefore per Franxx idiot logic, he is gay. With this character, Franxx approaches the topic of homosexuality as a developmental mistake, something you are born with then eventually grow out of. Which is just not true on any level. Sexuality is biodiversity, you\xe2\x80\x99re born that way or you\xe2\x80\x99re not. A person does not need \xe2\x80\x98a reason for being gay,\xe2\x80\x99 they just are. The fact that Franxx framed it as a discrepancy in Mitsuru and Ikuno\xe2\x80\x99s upbringing and that they have to grow out of it regardless of their how they feel is appalling. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHis turmoil over being in love with Hiro is swiftly brought to a close with him being forced into a relationship with Kokoro. She projects her desire to have a kid on him until he tepidly reciprocates because they are both convinced that unless they have a child they won\xe2\x80\x99t be fulfilled in life or ensure the future. Of course with no resolution for his unrequited love. The show goes out of its way to frame his marriage to Kokoro as an obligation rather than a choice. Similar to Futoshi, through subtle character direction you can tell Mitsuru\xe2\x80\x99s still pining for Hiro even in the episode he starts his relationship Kokoro. And there\xe2\x80\x99s never the same coding for Mitsuru being in love with Kokoro. Hiro flat out tells Mitsuru \xe2\x80\x9cyou ARE in love with Kokoro\xe2\x80\x9d and he accepts that hesitantly. It\xe2\x80\x99s as if the writers were trying to indicate that Mitsuru actually wanted to be with Hiro, but needed to suppress his feeling in order to prevent the metaphorical birth rate from declining. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven if these messages were unintentional, the creators of Franxx are playing with serious issues just for the sake of window dressing to make the sex-robot alien stuff seem less stupid, which is in my opinion just as offensive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPart 5: [Dr. Franxx, APE, \xe2\x80\x9cInhumanity,\xe2\x80\x9d and the scienceless sci-fi]<br />\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m an atheist, you see ( \xcd\xa1\xc2\xb0 \xcd\x9c\xca\x96 \xcd\xa1\xc2\xb0)\xe2\x80\x9d <br />\r\n-Dr. Franxx while licking his lips at the sight of the loli-monster-girl-princess. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur first introduction to the eponymous Dr. Franxx is him delivering his half-breed experiment kid Zero Two to Hiro\xe2\x80\x99s squad. One of his first lines is literally him sexually assaulting Nana, the squad&#039;s parental-type overseer, and telling her to loosen up. The show frames it as a joke because of course Franxx (the show) finds workplace assault to be fluffy humor. That\xe2\x80\x99s how he\xe2\x80\x99s characterized for most of the series, as a guy who does explicitly bad things like torturing Zero Two during \xe2\x80\x9cThe Prince and the Beast,\xe2\x80\x9d yet the show frames him as sympathetic. They really expected us to think, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s done bad things, but he really had some good ideas!\xe2\x80\x9d He had no value for human life, but somehow designing the awful sex-powered mechas absolves him? It\xe2\x80\x99s like a crazy person trying to defend Hitler. I Don\xe2\x80\x99t Fucking Care. He tortured and experimented on a kid, the show expected us to feel bad for him when he \xe2\x80\x98sacrificed himself\xe2\x80\x99 so everyone could survive at the end of episode 21. I literally applauded when a plot contrivance caused him to get violently crushed by rocks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAPE is just a bunch of aliens that came down to Earth and pretended to be an organization of scientists, they gave the government a new form of energy, magma and took over the world more or less. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very silly twist, but this is Franxx and it\xe2\x80\x99s a stupid show, magma could technically be used as a form of energy and greed could lead the government to trust mysterious scientists. But the magma is somehow also the key to unlocking immortality? How? Magma is molten rock, hot rocks! How the fuck do you make the logical leap between a form of energy and DNA mutation? It makes no goddamn sense! APE was just a bunch of random aliens that had so little to do with the main characters, it added nothing to what had been built up in the prior episodes. The magma energy constantly shown in background details supposedly caused the Earth to become deserts? Taking molten lava from the Earth (below the crust) would in no way affect the soil, it might lower the temperature of the surface but that would cause it to become cold, not hot. I&#039;m not sure who thought coming up with scientific-sounding words and a vaguely futuristic aesthetic would make good sci-fi, but it doesn&#039;t. Even I, someone who knows very little about science can tell this show is brain dead stupid and no effort went into researching its concepts. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThen after Franxx spends twenty-two episodes building up this illogical science, it throws in a giant twist in episode 20 that nullifies everything that came before it. Oh no! APE was actually aliens and now Zero Two\xe2\x80\x99s brain is trapped in space fighting them!! Who gives a shit? At this far into the series, the themes and pseudo-science were all the show cared about. Regardless of how badly they were written, at least it was something to engage with. All of the petty melodrama the characters face, all of the hackneyed lore, even the art quality goes down the toilet by episode 22. Franxx does these twists so often with its story, whenever it wants to achieve a climactic moment it just skips over the build-up and goes straight to the catharsis. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy the end of Darling in the Franxx, it doubles down on the ridiculous plot twists, desperate to make you take it seriously when you&#039;re more likely to laugh at it. In its final attempt to make you cry, it kills off it&#039;s two main characters, but even this lends no catharsis. The only catharsis you&#039;ll get from the ending of this train wreck is knowing you\xe2\x80\x99ll never have to watch it ever again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTL;DR<br />\r\n[Story: 0/10] Clichefest, contrived filler drama, terrible world building, nonsensical twists that nullify the whole story.<br />\r\n[Character: 0/10] I&#039;ve seen planks of wood more interesting and relatable than this entire cast.<br />\r\n[Art: 3/10] No visual identity, good battle sakuga in the first half with hideous mecha designs, very rushed towards the end.<br />\r\n[Sound: 3/10] Mediocre soundtrack, a waste of talented voice actors.<br />\r\n[Enjoyment: 0/10] Both intellectually and personally insulting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[Overall Score: 1/10]<br />\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s enough potential here to leave you curious as to what the writer/director Atsushi Nishigori might have created if he weren\xe2\x80\x99t so satisfied with repurposing classic anime into a clusterfuck that\xe2\x80\x99s less interesting than even one of its parts. He never understood what made their themes so impactful in the first place, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother to create an anime capable of standing on its own merits. Without a coherent story, remotely believable characters, or even themes rooted in reality, this show offers no redeeming value.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe best praise I can give to Darling in the Franxx is UNWATCHABLE. \n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_283200" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-283200">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Fanime%2F35849%2FDarling_in_the_FranXX" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle283200"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="283200">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=283200" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=283200" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right; text-align: right;">\n      <div title="8:31 AM">Jul 7, 2018</div>\n      <div class="lightLink spaceit">\n                  24 of 24 episodes seen\n              </div>\n      <div>\n        <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$(\'#score283206\').toggle()">Overall Rating</a>:\n        1\n      </div>\n    </div><div style="float: left;">\n      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">\n        <tr>\n                                              <td valign="top" width="60">\n              <div class="picSurround">\n                <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/Krunchyman">\n                  <img src="https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/userimages/thumbs/6553627_thumb.jpg" data-src="https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/userimages/thumbs/6553627_thumb.jpg" border="0" class=" lazyloaded">\n                </a>\n              </div>\n            </td>\n                    <td valign="top">\n                          <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/Krunchyman">Krunchyman</a>\n              <small>(<a href="/profile/Krunchyman/reviews">All reviews</a>)</small><br>\n                        <div class="lightLink spaceit">\n              <strong>\n                <span id="rhelp283206">344</span>\n              </strong>\n              people found this review helpful\n            </div>\n                      </td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class="spaceit textReadability word-break pt8 mt8" style="clear: both; border-top: 1px solid #ebebeb;">\n        <div style="float: left; display: none; margin: 0 10px 10px 0" id="score283206">\n      <table border="0" width="105" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="borderClass" style="border-width: 1px;">\n        <tr>\n          <td class="borderClass bgColor1"><strong>Overall</strong></td>\n          <td class="borderClass bgColor1"><strong>1</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td class="borderClass" align="left">Story</td>\n          <td class="borderClass">1</td>\n        </tr>\n                  <tr>\n            <td class="borderClass" align="left">Animation</td>\n            <td class="borderClass">1</td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td class="borderClass" align="left">Sound</td>\n            <td class="borderClass">1</td>\n          </tr>\n                <tr>\n          <td class="borderClass" align="left">Character</td>\n          <td class="borderClass">1</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td class="borderClass" style="border-width: 0;" align="left">Enjoyment</td>\n          <td class="borderClass" style="border-width: 0;">1</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n    </div>\n\n                          \n    4 Cups of Evangelion<br />\r\n2 tablespoons of granulated Gurren Lagann<br />\r\n1/4 teaspoon of Star Driver<br />\r\n1 dash of Beauty and the Beast<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd last, but not least.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n69 metric tons of CRAP! (freshly steamed)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn case it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t obvious, these are the instructions for one serving of Darling in the FranXX.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is a tacit understanding in the anime industry, as well as the filming industry, that you are allowed to draw inspiration from other works, but not plagiarize said works.  There are, of course, exceptions to this rule \xe2\x80\x94 particularly, in regards to satirical natured shows (Gintama and Inferno Cop, being the perfect examples) \xe2\x80\x94 however, solemn show\xe2\x80\x99s dance on\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review283206">\n        a very thin line, and must introduce innovative ideas to alter the perception on existing paradigms; otherwise, they come off as being cliched, and redundant.  From a monetary perspective, it makes sense to draw influence from other works, for example: Disney\xe2\x80\x99s Lion King took inspiration from Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s Hamlet and Kimba, the White Lion (an anime from Osamu Tezuka, the creator of Astro Boy).  Yet it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t absolve those involved from imbuing their own ideas and nuances to create something worthwhile.  Darling in the FranXX doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to comprehend this point, as it overtly uses critical elements from several other anime as a faux attempt of appearing sophisticated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor ease of reading, I have created a short list of instances that were copied, slightly altered, or outright stolen from other anime (this is not all-inclusive, as there are countless examples):<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-The underground city bears resemblance to Tokyo-3 and the Geofront from Evangelion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-The mysterious men/women in the white uniforms that have significant influence are rip-offs of SEELE from Evangelion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-The launch sequences are essentially mirror images of Evangelion\xe2\x80\x99s launch sequences (see a theme here).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-There was some kind of testing that was being performed in the early episodes that paralleled the synchronization tests in Evangelion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Episode 6 of Darling in the FranXX has been compared to episode 8 of Gurren Lagann.  Which makes perfect sense, since Atsushi Nishigori (the director of Darling in the FranXX) was the director for episode 8 of Gurren Lagann, but this brings up a more serious issue: why is Nishigori reusing old ideas from over ten years ago?  Not only that, but why is episode 6 of Darling in the FranXX a worse rendition of his earlier work (he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come up with improvements in all these years)?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Episode 13 is a reverse retelling of Beauty and the Beast \xe2\x80\x94 in fact, the title of the episode is The Beast and the Prince (they\xe2\x80\x99re not even attempting to disguise their intentions at this point).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Episode 20 we find out that VIRM wants to annihilate the klaxosaurs who retreated underground, similar to the spirals (who lived underground) fighting the anti-spirals in Gurren Lagann.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Mecha\xe2\x80\x99s transforming to absurd levels of scale and power like Gurren Lagann.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Instrumentality, much?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThen comes the real \xe2\x80\x9cbutt\xe2\x80\x9d of my issue with this series, and this concerns the \xe2\x80\x9cdoggy-styled\xe2\x80\x9d positions the girls must assume to pilot their Evangelions \xe2\x80\x94 I mean, their FranXX\xe2\x80\x99s.  It\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to engage the viewer through needless fan-service, but there are limits one can go before coming off as ridiculous.  Kill la Kill, another studio Trigger production, already ingratiated the anime community to the concept of excessive lasciviousness, the difference being: they did so with a self-deprecating tone.  This show, on the other hand, is treating the matter with solemnity; and sure, they attempt to shoehorn in a half-assed explanation, but the whole immortality subtlety doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fit well with the predetermined conclusion.  Immortality, as a concept, lends itself to numerous paths of intrigue about the overall worth of life, the monotony of existence, and the deterioration of cognitive faculties.  Alas, Darling in the FranXX (i.e. Studio Trigger) does not choose to expand on any of these philosophical conundrums, and instead, elects to go for sex and procreation \xe2\x80\x94 no surprise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHold your frustration back, because it gets worse.  In episode 8, when the girl\xe2\x80\x99s clothing gets disintegrated by the Klaxosaur \xe2\x80\x9cgoo,\xe2\x80\x9d revealing portions of their bodies to the boys, they decide to pull-out (Mitsuru should have done the same thing, hehe) the ultimate TV trope: dividing the house in half, with tape.  They straight up took this out of the I Love Lucy playbook.  Considering that sitcom television is the lowest form of televised entertainment known to man, it speaks volumes about an anime that takes inspiration from said \xe2\x80\x9cart form.\xe2\x80\x9d  It\xe2\x80\x99s like the anime staff couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be bothered to think of one original concept, so they just mashed a conglomerate of  ideas into a CGI mess of an anime.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe suggestive positioning of the girls, along with the incognizant sexual innuendo\xe2\x80\x99s surpasses the realm of idiocy, resembling the writing complexity of a soft-core porno.  We get it, the stamen (the boys) and the pistil (the girls) are references to the sexual organs of a flower; and the lack of trust (i.e. love) leads to incompatibility and a flaccid conclusion.  In other words: sex is not as meaningful without the love; especially when partners are switched amongst each other, implying unsympathetic cucking.  Then, in the final episodes, Nine Alpha rides with Hiro (bisexuality?), harkening back to Gurren Lagann when Simon put aside his differences with Viral in their final battle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget the first episode when Zero Two is catching fish with her mouth, in the nude.  It was a senseless scene that provided nothing more than reference material for future waxing sessions (you know what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about).  Seriously, though.  Why must Studio Trigger continue their quest of inducing the most boners in the anime community?  It use to be an art to inject promiscuousness into anime, now its so ubiquitous that if feels burdensome to the viewer.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you thought this review was scathing up until this point, then you would be correct. Nevertheless, stay tuned, because I\xe2\x80\x99m about to discuss the worst aspect of the show: the characters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6They all suck!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOkay.  That\xe2\x80\x99s not much of an analysis, but what can we really say about these characters?  Zero Two acts like a temperamental five year-old, who condescends to her superiors and comrades because that\xe2\x80\x99s what passes for cool nowadays.  She also likes to slather her food in honey and shove it down her \xe2\x80\x9cdarling\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d mouth.  Speaking of which, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what\xe2\x80\x99s worse: Yuno, from Mirai Nikki, saying \xe2\x80\x9cYuki\xe2\x80\x9d, or Zero Two saying \xe2\x80\x9cdarling.\xe2\x80\x9d  They are both excruciating to the eardrums.  Her \xe2\x80\x9cdarling,\xe2\x80\x9d Hiro, is your typical mundane protagonist, lacking identifying characteristics that would engage the viewer and become interested in his plight towards becoming a FranXX pilot.  He is, however, infatuated with Zero Two to the point of feeling dead inside without her presence (get over it dude, your like, 14?)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe rest of the cast, unfortunately, is a compilation of tired tropes that have been utilized time and time again.  In fact, I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember any of their names, so I won\xe2\x80\x99t waste your time, and mine, looking them up just to explain how trivial their roles really are.  Suffice it to say, the cast is a representation of the anime staff\xe2\x80\x99s laziness, but considering this show has a higher rating than the reboot of Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu (which has an excellent cast of characters), it should come as no surprise why anime writers continue to shove monotonous characters down our throats ad infinitum.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to sound too presumptuous, but this may be the worst anime I have ever seen in my life \xe2\x80\x94 or, at the very least, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the running.  As it stands, the current list of the worst anime goes as follows (in no particular order):<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1)  Mirai Nikki<br />\r\n2)  Sword Art Online<br />\r\n3)  Bio Broly<br />\r\n4)  Boku no Pico<br />\r\n5)  Darling in the FranXX<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConsidering they copied everything else from Evangelion, it is only fitting to compliment Darling in the FranXX for their crappy achievement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCongratulations!

Darling in the Franxx. <br />\r\nAfter the success of Little Witch Academia and Kill la Kill, as well as the unfortunate failure of Kiznaver Studio Trigger, decided to make Darling In The Franxx but with the help of A1 Pictures/Cloverworks. Like many others on the internet, I was really excited for Darling in the Franxx. Maybe that was my biggest mistake and like with Beatless, Black Clover and Re:Zero I was expecting too much. However, even if the anime had failed to live\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review283204">\n        up to expectations the anime would be still be entertaining so bad it\xe2\x80\x99s good to watch. Unfortunately Darling in the Franxx is not so bad it\xe2\x80\x99s a good type of shows. In fact, Darling in the Franxx is by far one the fucking worst written and directed anime I have ever seen period. Say what you want about Black Clover, The Asterisk Wars, Big Order and Eromanga Sensei for being for worst shows than this but least those shows had the so bad its good effect where despite these shows being horrendous least they were actually funny. This show from start to finish was not funny at all as it only got more insulting and stupid as it progressed and because of that am going to end my intro here because since this show doesn&#039;t give a damn about its viewer so why should I.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFUCK MY LIFE!!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAct I: The broken written and directed mess of a story that has no idea of it it&#039;s doing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the distant future. The world is ruined, and humanity establishes mobile fort cities called \xe2\x80\x9cplantations\xe2\x80\x9d. Pilots produced inside Plantation live in Mistilteinn, also known as the \xe2\x80\x9cbirdcage.\xe2\x80\x9d Children living there know nothing of the outside world or the freedom of the sky. Their lives consist of battling to carry out missions. Their enemies are mysterious giant life forms known as Klaxosaur, and the children pilot machines called Franxx to face off against them. For the children, riding the Franxx proves their existence. The story follows a boy named Hiro who goes by the code 016 has lost motivation and self-confidence after failing an aptitude test. Skipping out class graduation\xc2\xa0Hiro goes to the lack where he encounters a girl with two horns and she quickly introduces by her code name Zero Two. She has been infamously known as a partner killer where none of her partners survive after the third ride. Before they properly interact they the Plantation is rocked by a sudden Klaxosaur attack. After Zero Two failed attempt to engage the Klaxosaur\xc2\xa0as well her partner dying Zero Two invites Hiro to pilot the mecha with her and from there Zero Two, Hiro, and the crew must fight against the Klaxosaur\xe2\x80\x99s in order to save humanity.<br />\r\nThere are so many problems with this show I seriously don\xe2\x80\x99t know where to begin.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor starters, the story is very dull and boring as hell. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care about many events in the story because I was bored by them and I thought they were poorly executed. It\xe2\x80\x99s also rips off a lot of better mecha anime without understanding of what made them good for example Hiro and Zero are just poor-mans versions of Demonic and Anemone where they relationships are similar but it was done better in Eureka Seven as there was a lot of build up for Demonic and Anemone to grow as characters before they formed a relationship with each other. Also, did I forget that Demonic and Anemone are far better-written characters than Zero Two and Hiro will ever be.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDarling in the Franxx also has some of the worst pacing I have ever seen in any anime as the show consistently waste its time on pointless bullshit instead of focusing on relevant things that are important to the overall narrative.<br />\r\nThe world-building for Darling in the Franxx is god awful. Besides from the episodes 7, 10 and 19 where the show\xc2\xa0briefly did world-building in a bad way the show never even bothers at establishing its own setting and because of this, the world in Darling in the Franxx is incredibly empty. Where do the Klaxosaurs come from? What\xc2\xb4s this organization that&#039;s fighting against them? In which time is this series set? What kind of government there is there this world?\xc2\xa0How old are each parasite in the series are? This show never explains any of these things because screw worldbuilding lets just have characters go out with the pathetic and cringe-worthy character drama that is contrived as hell. These issues along with the pacing would eventually bite the show in the ass later on which I will talk about in a bit.<br />\r\nDarling In The Franxx is also the dumbest show ever to take itself too seriously where the show tries to be all serious, smart and edgy with its monologues, symbolism, and themes but because of the horrendous tone shifts and flashy fan-service it completely makes the show very pretentious as a result of its themes and speaking of themes.<br />\r\nThis show also does a horrendous job at presenting its themes and topics to a point certain characters in the show just preach about sex, love, and family all over the fucking place without any context and real reasoning. It doesn&#039;t the fact this show has the maturity level of a horney 12-year-old.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother issue of Darling in the Franxx is how it really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what show it wants to be as it keeps changing its damm genre in almost every freaking episode?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDoes it want to be balls off the wall dumb mecha show?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDoes it want to be a sitcom?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDoes it want to be a mystery anime?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDoes it want to be a slice of life show?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDoes it want to be a coming of age story?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDoes it want to be a serious mecha show that deals with a lot of sensitive topics and themes?<br />\r\nWho the hell knows because this anime clearly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t and top it all out because this show tries to squeeze in many genres as possible the pacing and the tone of the series becomes fucked.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAct II: The boring and\xc2\xa0infuriating cliched empty characters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCharacterisation and character development in Darling in the Franxx are practically non-existent thanks to the show having a nasty habit of using certain elements that completely prevent any form of character growth and because of that am currently struggling to find a series with more empty characters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur male protagonist Hiro is a boring empty husk who barely even capable of producing the energy required being a mecha protagonist. He has no personality on his own and there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that stands about him as the way his written and designs is awful. Plus all the character development that he gets feels forced and unnatural. Not to mention he becomes a much worser character as the series goes on but we will get to that in a bit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nZero Two is an awfully written waifu pandering character with no substance.<br />\r\nDespite being the character that has the most personality from this bland cast she is still a pathetic written character that has no substance that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t develop for shit. She also has a stupid and annoying sexy horney personality where she constantly preaches about being with Hiro.<br />\r\nThe final nail of the coffin for this piece of shit character is that she is just a god damm wish fulfillment/waifu pandering character where outside of the awfully predictable romance with Hiro she just there to pander to the lowest common denominator. Fuck this character and her wish-fulfillment bullshit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe rest of the characters from the\xc2\xa0Thirteenth Plantation are absolutely awful.<br />\r\nZorome and Miku are both loud mouthed tsundere\xe2\x80\x99s who like to yell a lot. They don&#039;t have a purpose to the narrative at all other to be background noise.<br />\r\nGoro is a boring bro type character that we all have seen before who is very friendly and protective to people.<br />\r\nFutoshi is your typical fat friendly guy who likes to stuff his mouth with food all the time.<br />\r\nKokoro is a shy girl who has a good heart.<br />\r\nIkuno is a very calm and collected girl who loves to read books.<br />\r\nMitsuru is the prideful guy who has a superiority complex.<br />\r\nIchigo or as I like to call her Bitchigo for being an insufferable contrived bitch is your cookie cutter childhood character that we all seen before.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDo you guys see a problem here? Not only the characters in Darling in the Franxx are tropey as fuck but they can&#039;t even stand up on they own as characters.<br />\r\nThe rest of the characters are all equally awful and not even worth mentioning at all as they all feel like Gurren Lagann and Evangelion character rejects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat makes this worse is how this show plays with its audience with its half fast character development that didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter thanks to character resets.<br />\r\nOne of the examples of this was in episode 10 where the show tried to develop Zorome as a character you know that brat who behaves like Boruto. He got great character development in that episode and by the end of the episode they decided to kill off all the characters development that he had and went back to the same loudmouth tsundere character from episode 1.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t me started with Episode 14 with the whole Ichigo bullshit. Okay while she didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose her memory or anything she devolved to a whiny and unsympathetic bitch of a captain who constantly gets too emotional about Hiro and that completely who against all of her previous character development in episode 9 with Goro. The final coffin for Bitchigo is that as soon as Zero Two leaves she literally takes advantage of Hiro by kissing him.<br />\r\nBitch, we get it you don\xe2\x80\x99t like Zero Two but did you really have go out of your fucking way to tell everyone in the room that members from the\xc2\xa0Thirteenth Plantation won\xe2\x80\x99t take apart in the battle unless they tell kick Zero Two off and on top of that you go confess to him even though you got Goro as a love interest. I understand you want to project your childhood friend from danger but this was the dumbest way to do it and because of that you just became one of the dumbest characters to ever exist in an anime<br />\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s also that stupid love subplot with Kokoro and Mitsuru but I will get to that in a bit because that subplot alone killed the show it an idiotic fashion.<br />\r\nHonestly, what is a point of being a coming of age story if you only to going to reset character development and motivations? I swear the staff was god damm clueless knowing the basic elements of a coming of age story.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAct III: The cringe homage festival aka episodes 20-24<br />\r\n(Spoilers Ahead)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow if you thought the first 19 episodes were awful you ain&#039;t seen nothing yet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe final 5 episodes of Darling in the Franxx are some of the worst final episodes I have ever seen in any anime.<br />\r\nNot only it was horrendously build up but the way that the show that disgustingly changed its tone was infuriating because it took one of the shows biggest problems and took it to a next level where the show tries to squeeze all the story elements from NGE, Kill la Kill, Gunbuster and Gurren Lagann without understanding of what made those\xc2\xa0story elements great and because of those reasons the pacing, narrative, direction, production values and especially worldbuilding becomes broken.<br />\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s like the creators in the show had no fucking idea of what the hell they were doing plus you could clearly tell they were on a tight deadline.<br />\r\nI can even predict how the staff of the show was handing the final 5 episodes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreator 1: Hey what episode are we on now?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreator 2: Ummmm episode 20 I think<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreator 1: OH SHIT<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreator 1: What the fuck we need to get going as we only have 4 episodes left now. How do we fix this?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreator 2: (Looks for Gundam 00 Movie and Chicken Little Blu Rays and shows them to Creator 1) Have you tried aliens that usually end things.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreator 1: But isn\xe2\x80\x99t that cheap.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreator 2: Do you have a better idea.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreator 1: I told you we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have spent so much time on individual characters only for them to not develop at all,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreator 2: Too late now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreator 1: Screw it. Just add aliens in the series and call it a day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat makes this worst is that if your someone like me who likes goes back to watch earlier episodes of the show to catch certain story/character elements that you missed the first time around. However, in the process of revisiting certain episodes in Darling in the Franxx you will start to see poorly made and directed this show is and it got to a point where you could have removed or shortened certain episodes like for example episode 8 Boy x Girls.<br />\r\nThat episode alone was the beginning of the shows horrible writing and direction because only they did a horrendous job at exploring the theme of puberty but the reasoning for the girls to set the line for the dorms was horrendous and contrived.<br />\r\nThis conflict alone would have been solved in 5 minutes but thanks to this show stupidity it decided to drag it out to point where it becomes contrived with its stupid character drama that had no reason to exist other to preach the theme of puberty to the audience.<br />\r\nGirls in this show I understand you want to protect your bodies but in a war-zone, especially on a scale battle, no one will give a shit about your sex life because in a battle you either kill or be killed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t get me started with the whole romance subplot between Kokoro and\xc2\xa0Mitsuru where instead of the show foreshadowing and building up story events. The show decides wastes its time on two episodes on a  terribly contrived romance subplot that characters who have no character chemistry with each other whatsoever. Plus that subplot didn\xe2\x80\x99t even matter because as Hiro decided to pull off a wedding for these two the show decided to take that subplot and flushes it\xe2\x80\x99s down the toilet by having these characters lose they memories after being captured by the Nines. What made this subplot even worse thanks to a dialogue asspull by Mitsuru in episode 23 where he states that &#039;&#039;even without our memories we can start all over again&#039;&#039; even though the show had made it clear at the end of episode 18 that Kokoro and Mitsuru cannot regain or make new memories with each other whatsoever.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWords cannot describe how contrived and poorly executed this subplot was because the only reason why this subplot even exist at all is to showcase its fanfic writing. The show already had a lot of fanatic writing, to begin with, but this one takes the cake for being the most insufferable subplot I have ever seen in a long while.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis doesn&#039;t just end there Episode 19 is a complete waste of time. While the show for the last time tried to do its world-building it failed miserably becauae everything else on that episode ended up being pointless. Not to mention that episode quickly devolved to a typical sob backstory for Dr Franxx of how he became the person that he is today thanks to his motivations in the past. However two episodes later he get&#039;s killed off Akame Ga Kill style where chararters get they backstories or sob stories before they are killed off one to two episodes later. What&#039;s a point of having a backstory of a chararter if your only going to kill them off one to two episodes later? This is atrocious writing and direction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe last thing I want to talk about is Hiro as a character. Do you remember when where I previously called Hiro an empty husk? Well after episode 15 this sack of shit literally devolved into a freaking Gary Sue who preaches about Hiro. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about you guys but I have never seen a protagonist in a fictional work that literally started off being horrible empty husk to being an insufferable preachy Gary Sue where every single piece of dialogue is about Zero Two and nothing else. It also got to a point where in episode 22 where Hiro would rather choose to save his sex object aka Zero Two in space instead of helping his friends and follow parasyte survive. Some say that his change of personality from being an empty shell is a good thing but for actually writing it&#039;s not because at the of the day he went from an empty husk to a preachy Gary Sue who only cares about Zero Two.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI could go on and on talking about the shows plotholes such as Hiro being able to ride with 9\xce\xb1 who is also a male character as well not a nine&#039;s member, characters not reconsidering that Ikuno hair colour has changed to white, Ichigo being able to plot her mecha even though there is no male pilot, members of APE only wiping out only Kokoro and Misturu memories instead of all the\xc2\xa0Thirteenth Plantation members to Zero Two being able to transform into a mecha at the end of episode 23 but since this show doesn&#039;t give a damm about writing and directing why I should I even bother.<br />\r\n(End Of Spoilers)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAm finally done talking about the show&#039;s plot and chararters.<br />\r\nOverall the story was hot garbage, really hot garbage. This felt like an awful Gainax fanfic that was done by a horney 12 year old on fanfic.net. The pacing was awful the character drama was insufferable. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t give a shit about any of the characters and writing/directing especially in the final 5 episodes were god awful. This is one of the worst told stories I had ever had the displeasure of watching.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAct IV: The almighty cheap and uninspired production values that have no soul and charm.<br />\r\nSaying that Darling in the Franxx look like shit is a fast understatement because this is by far one of the worst looking and animated shows I have ever seen from this decade.<br />\r\nIt may look decent at first but the more of watch this show you will start to see how lazy animated the show is as it starts to use animation shortcuts to cover up the show ugliness and lazy directing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe character designs are all horrendously bad and uninspired.<br />\r\nHiro is basically Dominic from Eureka Seven but downgraded.<br />\r\nZero Two who despite being the best-looking character in the show is a downgraded\xc2\xa0Anemone from Eureka Seven with added horns on her face and a bit of makeup.<br />\r\nIchigo looks like a more deformed version of Rem from Re:Zero.<br />\r\nZorome looks like a blander Boruto with that brown hair.<br />\r\nMiku looks more like an Asuka reject that Hideaki Anno decided to throw in the bin. decided to and the rest of the ranged from being uninspired knockoff to being downright awful especially Futoshi who is by far one of the worst characters designs I have ever seen any anime.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe mecha designs are even worse as they all look like they were done by a horney 12-year-old. Am sure that the same horney 12-year-old designed all the\xc2\xa0Klaxosaur&#039;s in this show\xc2\xa0because they all look terrible.<br />\r\nAnother thing that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the art is how cheap it looks in terms of color. It\xe2\x80\x99s like someone from secondary school in art class who is not good at art decided to paint over the background, character to even mecha designs forgetting to add detail in the progress. It just makes the anime look cheap and lazy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t get me started how inconstant the art was as at various times character to even the mechas go off model to a point where the show can look incredibly ugly.<br />\r\nThe animation in this show is just flat out horrendous. Still frames up the ass, characters constantly going off-model, horrible fight choreography, stiff and awkward movement, to even the frame rate at one moment of episode 23 where the show had the frame-rate of 3.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverall visuals were just awful is uninspired and has no charm and soul.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nACT V: The somewhat enjoyable soundtrack and great opening and ending themes.<br />\r\nThe music is the best thing about this show. The soundtrack is pretty alright what it was as it does a good job at presenting its setting and tone of the series then again having a good soundtrack doesn&#039;t automatically make an anime any good.<br />\r\nThe opening Kiss to Death is a great opening theme that is very catchy that I really enjoyed especially the version 2 of the same opening from episode 16 onwards with the different lyrics.<br />\r\nAll the ending themes are pretty good and catchy in they own ways.<br />\r\nIn short, both the opening and ending themes are good and it\xe2\x80\x99s easily the best thing to ever come out from this anime.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nACT VI Finale: The borderline hentai dub acting and audio quality.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe sub is pretty good overall that is filled with talented Seiyuus that did a good job with the roles that they were given.<br />\r\nThe dub, on the other hand, is absolutely horrendous. There was not a single good performance in the dub as all the voice actors sound like they were doing a hentai production. Not only that but it makes an already horrendous series almost unwatchable thanks to its shitty audio quality.<br />\r\nAs a person who loves English Dub as a whole watching this show dubbed episode 1-20 was pure misery. One of the worst dubs I have ever heard.<br />\r\nIf you had to pick a choice stick with the sub for this one than again why would you even watch this broken mess of a show, to begin with?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEpilogue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x99\xab\xe2\x99\xab\xe2\x99\xab\xe2\x99\xab It all returns to nothing, it all comes tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down...\xe2\x99\xab\xe2\x99\xab\xe2\x99\xab\xe2\x99\xab&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo that\xe2\x80\x99s was Darling in the Franxx.<br />\r\nA broken, pathetically written and directed train-wreck mess of a show that disgustingly plays with it&#039;s audience emotions. It has pathetic characters, horrendously written character drama, contrived subplots that have no reason to exists other to pad out time, laughable production values, pathetic world-building, horrendous pacing, poorly executed themes and most importantly this show has no respect of what it trying to homage/rip-off as it keeps on poorly homaging a lot of Evangelion, Gurren Lagann, Gunbuster and Eureka 7 elements without having any understanding of what made those shows great in the first place.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther than the music there is nothing and I mean NOTHING redeemable or good about this series whatsoever.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is one of the worst animes I ever had the displeasure of watching.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, I have to say this. When even the worst mecha shows like Gundam Seed Destiny, Brain Powered and Aldnoah Zero where despite them being more flawed has more things going for them and manages to outclass you in certain aspects you know you have fucked up on a scale that is immeasurable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you want to a good mecha show that features great character drama and great story elements go watch Eureka Seven, Gurren Lagann or Neon Genesis Evangelion.<br />\r\nIf you want to watch a good anime from Studio Trigger? Watch Little Witch Academia Space Patrol Luluco and Kill la Kill.<br />\r\nIf you want to watch a good anime from A1 Pictures? Watch Shinsekai Yori, Space Brothers, and Magi.<br />\r\nAvoid this show like the plague.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinal Score 0.5/10\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_283204" class="mt8
