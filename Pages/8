I have watched the anime (well 5 episodes for now, cause it seems the anime is still airing) , and read the manga (49 chapters). I will try to keep my review to the anime only, but there is something, and that&#039;s I don&#039;t trust this review. I don&#039;t want to spoil it for people who will read the manga. But when newer episodes come, this review may no longer hold.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut for now, it&#039;s a typical heartwarming anime, a good one, but not one with much to talk about. Oh and yes, these\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286748">\n        ratings only apply to the anime&#039;s story, not manga I&#039;ve read.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStory(7/10) : Kind of hard to decide, as it really doesn&#039;t have much of a story. It&#039;s pretty much a boy and a girl. The boy doesn&#039;t care about anything but games, so he&#039;s dense to the girl&#039;s feelings. That really is just it. There is one more girl too, but they didn&#039;t even meet yet (but they might in the oncoming episodes). It&#039;s heartwarming and cute.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArt(4/10) : Can&#039;t really defend this. Just look at it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSound(6/10) : It&#039;s fair, I suppose. Not much to complain about, but not that great either.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCharacter(8.5/10) : This is good, especially considering the genre. The game crazy boy,  a rich &quot;ojou-sama&quot; who also happens to be a crazy gamer, and one more girl who&#039;s just a cute normie. And then there&#039;s protoganist&#039;s mom. BEST MOM EVER !!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnjoyment(7.5/10) : Pretty cute and heartwarming.

This is the best commercial to ever exist. It&#039;s a car designed for Char motherfucking Aznable. He uses it to drive to his robot when he needs to get to it fast.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis car actually exists.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou better believe that this is the closest we&#039;ll ever get to actual Gundams. This is the only technology from the Gundam universe to appear in our lives. Cherish it, my brothers and sisters. It&#039;s worthy of celebration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike, have you seen the photos of this beast? It&#039;s the most stupidly flashy car in existence. You know all those\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286747">\n        cringy photos of cars with anime stickers? You can actually get this one with anime stickers already on it! And not just any sticker, it&#039;s the Zeon sign, carefully painted onto the car.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can literally buy a car with a sign of Gundam&#039;s interpretation of the Nazis. How is this real? The absolute mad lads in Japan allowed for this. Heil Zeon my dudes!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, there are apparently two colors. One&#039;s red for Char and one&#039;s green to look like the Zakus I guess. I just want to inform you, that if you ever even think about buying the green one instead of the red one, you&#039;re dead in my eyes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo yeah, if it wasn&#039;t clear enough, I want this car, the red one. I accept any donations toward this goal. PM me if you want to help the cause.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHelp I&#039;m poor.\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286747" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286747">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286747"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286747">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286747" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286747" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

From the story boards to the voice acting, it\xe2\x80\x99s all hard work and problems occur all the time. Shirobako is an anime about creating anime. Well, that may sound strange to some of you, I mean watching something about creating what you\xe2\x80\x99re watching? If you\xe2\x80\x99re curious about this show, I highly recommend you watch it. You\xe2\x80\x99ll discover a great story about 5 girls with a dream to create their own anime. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re reading this I assume you like anime, but have you ever\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286746">\n        wanted to create your own? A group of friends, Aoi Miyamori, Ema Yasuhara, Shizuka Sakaki, Midori Imai, and Misa Toudou all have a wish to create an anime together. After creating a short anime in the anime club during their time in high school, the 5 girls set out to find a career in anime. The girls struggle to pursue their dream as they run into problems such as not finding a job, not being able to work in what they want to work on, or even figuring out why they want to work in anime. Through this show, we discover a whole new story from behind the scenes that we would have never have thought of-\xe2\x80\xa6. well I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there are some shows or movies out there with a similar concept. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnyways this show is great. With bits of slice of life, comedy, and drama, we see what the creators of our favorite shows go through as they work hard to entertain us. It\xe2\x80\x99s a perfect show to learn to appreciate the work that is put into the anime we watch every day. And possibly even be inspired to create your own anime. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nStory: 9/10 <br />\r\nThe story is easily relatable if you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever tried to work hard on something but didn\xe2\x80\x99t succeed, or work on something without a clear sight on the future. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main goal of the story is to get closer to the main characters goal, to create an anime together. <br />\r\n*spoiler alert* <br />\r\nWhich by the end of the show, they kind of did actually make an anime together, just not the anime they wanted. And with the announcement of a movie for Shirobako, I believe they girls will get closer to their goal. <br />\r\n*end of spoiler* <br />\r\nOverall great and relatable story! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCharacters: 9/10 <br />\r\nThe characters of Shirobako, especially the 5 main girls, go through problems throughout the show. And with some of the side characters who have gone through the same, many of them get through it with their help. It\xe2\x80\x99s like your sempai helping you with school issues or something I guess. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe characters are all really likable and relatable, some you just want to punch in the face (funny story guy), but overall, I think they each (the main characters) have an important role to play in the story. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI personally really liked Shizuka and-<br />\r\n*spoiler alert* <br />\r\nafter seeing her in the last part of episode 23 where she finally got a voice acting role, I cried so GODDAMN HARD. <br />\r\n*end of spoiler*<br />\r\nAlso, she\xe2\x80\x99s very similar to Nanami from Sakura-sou no Pet na Kanojo (The Pet Girl of Sakurasou). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nArt: 7/10 <br />\r\nThe art is easy to look at, though nothing special about it. <br />\r\nJust pretty standard. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSound: 8/10<br />\r\nI personally loved the openings and endings of the show. Though at first, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem all that special. I guess it grew on me, don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s the same for you. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe background music wasn\xe2\x80\x99t noticeable for me. I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember most of it since it didn\xe2\x80\x99t stand out at all. The only time I noticed it was when they played the ending song (I think) at the end of episode 24. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10<br />\r\nDuring the first few episodes, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get into the story as much. But as the story progress and I learnt more about the characters, I really started to enjoy the show more than I did at the beginning. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about everyone else but I think you really got to get past the character introductions (there are so many characters) and world building to actually enjoy everything (probably like every show ever). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverall: 8.4/10 <br />\r\nShirobako, after finishing it became one of my favorite animes. I definitely cannot wait until the release of the movie. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure to review that too. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnyways, great show! I recommend this if you\xe2\x80\x99re interested in the anime industry. <br />\r\n\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286746" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286746">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286746"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286746">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286746" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286746" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

And that&#039;s because, above all, its animation and soundtrack coincide very well. Although there were certain episodes that lost the essence of &quot;familiar&quot; as in the episode of the beach where, Hotaru, came to show very feminine parts ... but hey, it really is not something past the line.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs I can say many times: animation is what matters most to me and it seems that this anime has not failed me. I still wonder why the manga is not widely read ...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286744">\n        think that since that series I started to give that inspiration to see the anime Slice of Life, something I&#039;m very grateful for this.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is fortunate that Renge is a very popular loli in animation. And it&#039;s not bad, she is very nice, nice and nice to see.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen I found out that the anime would be worked by the Silver Link studio, I never thought that it would work so well. But they did a good job!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe most expected of this is the movie!!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy the way, the character, Suguru Koshigaya, has a personality similar to mine.

Because I simply just could not bring myself past the scene were Soma decides to bring out his all-time greatest mistake, squid and peanut butter combined and having a girl with blue pigtails munch down on it, giving her a reaction I just could not get into. I rolled my eyes and\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286743">\n        thought, \xe2\x80\x9c Oh, great. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of those animes, that just sexualizes the reaction and body parts of females, getting a close to sexual arousal as they possibly can before kicking the bucket into dark waters.\xe2\x80\x9d And I clicked off the screen, this scenario happens 3 times, until finally sitting down and watching the episode until the very end. Immediate addiction was accomplished.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat Did I Dislike About The Anime?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen I watch a series I usually have little to no negative things to say about it because I simply just watch things I know I\xe2\x80\x99ll enjoy. That can also become a flaw if you\xe2\x80\x99re someone who also enjoys writing about the Anime afterwards for others to read, it can become Biased and just follow the trail of what others have already said and done, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying this is a bad thing but I am saying it can be a small let down when you cannot find one little thing to dislike about something you\xe2\x80\x99ve grown to love, right? Everyone makes mistakes, even the lovely folks behind the magical anime curtain. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, what I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like about Food Wars? Simple, but again, this is my opinion. I felt as though some of the reactions were a bit over the top, kind of using it as a way to brush by some important topics involving the characters, kind of like how Animators thought of drawing characters with only 4 fingers instead of 5 to save time, I only have 2 examples for this layout since it really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a huge huge big deal breaker for me but it was a let down in my view of the characters and their personality potentials given within the shared screen time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s use Ikumi Mito as an example since she really ended up being a character that I love and want to know so much more about, her appearance is quite obvious, right? Giant chest size, tanned skin, wears clothes that flash her body at every angle in almost every screen time shot she got within this season (besides the very last episode where she has on a purple sweater and still a short white mini skirt.) and has and overwhelming knowledge of meat besides all of that, I feel instead of just her being that supportive character with the huge chest and expert of meat, she should of been given that time to express herself within in different way, the way she was designed and the way her personality was portrayed didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite match up for my liking, she was shy yet within episode 17 when Soma gives her a call because he\xe2\x80\x99s in need of her knowledge of meat she steps out and stops to look at her reflections within a shops window that has a more \xe2\x80\x9c Appropriate\xe2\x80\x9d dressing attire, she then questions if she should have dressed differently but then decided she should be herself and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care what anyone thinks, therefore her being extremely confident, then going back to being shy and self-conscious when she meets Soma&#039;s childhood friend for the first time, Megumi. Cause she obviously fancies Soma in a romantic way, point being, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t they 1. Makes her appearance match her strong personality, and obvious brains and passion she shared for meat show more throughout the series. 2. Give us more of a background of her life when she was helping Soma and felt a kind of vulnerability deep down while she was there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nErina Nakiri, also a character I just assumed we would find more about the more we got into these episodes since it is put out that the series perhaps revolves around this girl and Soma some way and somehow. We really got to know little about her, she\xe2\x80\x99s also very smart, confident, and really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take no for an answer. But her character is also put through a silky shade of vulnerability when Some comes into the picture, especially when we see she misses the bus just to hurry and go back for the photo she keeps in a book of her as a child and Soma father, I most certainly understand that these types of things might be held off for further seasons, to not spoil too much of the characters true colors and ways of thinking and acting, but I feel they led me astray at first, always thinking \xe2\x80\x9c Maybe I get to find out why she\xe2\x80\x99s so shut in about this guy, what\xe2\x80\x99s got her so anxious and afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d  To sum all this up, I just wish they focused a bit more on showing us the true colors of the characters and not so much on the sexual appeal of reactions when it came to food tasting. I could also say the same about the mysterious and joyful some 7th seat Satoshi Isshiki, haha. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat Did I Like About This Anime?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis anime no doubt has more positives than negatives in my personal book,<br />\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a series that captures the interest of everyone that may take the chance to watch it.<br />\r\nWith each and every episode and line that\xe2\x80\x99s put into this Anime, the characters always have an overwhelming and powerful impact on the story and audience as a whole, the episode that really brought this thought to life was in episode 14, this one brought a huge smile on my face, watching them cook their hearts out while also being educated on the subject this Anime revolves around was truly an amazing feeling. The bonds that they all weave throughout the series makes it just as great, to be best friends but also give it your all and go head to head against one another is a heck of a thing to watch happen, this anime really know not just how to make you see the love and the tension but also feel it and taste it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEducational? Yeah, the smarts. I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually know if this is all set in stone but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the point of making all that food knowledge up is worth it for a series that is going to make it as big as this one, right? Correct me down below if I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong though. I really love how they incorporated all types of cooking skills, foods, and countries within this Anime, it was super refreshing to see everyone from all over get along and help one another out, so in the end they would combine skills and foods from their region of birth with traditional Japanese dishes, Beautiful even.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe art style! Was phenomenal, if I must say, it was really amazing and breathtaking, I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about every single scene and frame too, the colors really popped out and complemented each other greatly. Each character not only had their own specific way of being drawn or colors that made them stand out, they all, once again, complemented each other. Usually in Anime you can really tell which ones are going to be the main focus, now, of course, this Anime\xe2\x80\x99s cast was much bigger than others so they all had to have their own filings, but even some of the supporting background students had color that popped and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really notice a lazy point in any of their designs, colorful or not. I give them full props for that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne final input I\xe2\x80\x99d like to add on this like list is that I really, really, really enjoyed that the Anime didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to hounded in on focusing on Soma being the main attractions, all characters were equally sprawled out to be the backbone of one another, throughout the Anime. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t find any of them overpoweringly annoying or too dependant on another character. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286743" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286743">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286743"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286743">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286743" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286743" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

The revelations put in are small and should not compromise much to those who have not yet seen, but the warning that has revelations has been left.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSound (02/10) <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe opening, closing, and fighting songs are certainly good, but they are erased by the rest of the bad work. The soundtrack during the episodes alternates between songs not very original, and ill suited to the moments, with silences, or simply throw those boring\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286742">\n        crickets exaggeratedly. The damn crickets are everywhere, all the time and even the voices of the characters are inaudible with so many crickets, it does not make any difference because they speak in Japanese, but because of the excess is boring.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArt (02/10) <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCertainly the darker atmosphere combines with the anime, but the recurring use appears to be to hide the problems of badly made scenarios, this when done, since we often have only the black background. It really displeases the look because of the scenarios that are often very little detailed such as the rustic features in the buildings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpeaking of scenario problems, there are some errors. There is a specific scene of an error where the characters are descending an escalator, and the ladder goes very slowly, while the one on the rising side goes very fast. They are details, they are small things, but when added they weigh a lot.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCountless scenes that are completely static or with few movements, like the character only wiggle his mouth, or only an object moves in the scenery, or just one element of the scene. They can not say that this is a defect if it does not bother them, but also they can not value an anime that abuses scenes so to the detriment of those who do a great job. Comparing with Akira who is from 1988 in these terms of fluidity, and in details of scenarios is without comparison, although Akira is older seven years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nScience fiction and futuristic is dated more quickly, but this anime is quite dated, and bother the scenarios. Even with the limitations of the time, there are those of the same period who have managed to overcome and go far beyond.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn many moments the anime uses a lighting technique to put a character on the scene, this has its charm, and depending on the situation is very good. However the technique being widely used in so many episodes loses visual weight. In addition, they are static scenes, as putting someone in the place is much more complicated than just lighting a light and so does not match the argument of those who say that the anime is fluid.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn last episodes the visual effects became even more garish. Brilliant color issues, lights and black screens with letters, soon bother a lot. And still in this final part has mixture with real scenes, being that it was to be an anime and not live-action. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are many comics with texts, which can prove that the director was not knowing how to pass the message and had to write, the logic is that this was to be an anime and not light novel. Also it is likely that he were trying to hide defects of anime with introduction of cuts through these comics, but anyway, regardless of the reason, do not give time to read.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGoing to the world building, if Antarctica melted as the anime explains the consequence would be the rise of sea level between 65 to 80 meters. However, 80 percent of the planet&#039;s population is concentrated on the coast, but that would be only the impact of the flood, then all climate change would come, and we still have to consider the tsunami giants that would occur through rapid melting. Give to believe in a world almost completely destroyed by catastrophes, and shortly after they built that technological city? Is not anyone seeing a scenario problem?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey created this apocalyptic world, where a city is a military base of resistance which from time to time monsters come and attack. Is 90&#039;s everyday life in this world correct? Even the existence of everyday scenarios is correct?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe city land a part while the rest is being destroyed by godzilla mode, and then back to normal like nothing had happened. It may even be beautiful from a poetic point of view, but it does not make sense, especially that buried structure and years eighties style. If only they had made it clear that the physics of this universe has nothing to do with ours, but not , and the concept of that city is restlessly absurd.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlready the wreckage and rubble of the city should be apparent after each attack of angels, should show destruction by all sides. But these things are simply ignored, because it&#039;s more convenient for the next Angel attack the same city. Give more work to make another scenario, and that is what called power rangers style.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven when the scenery changes there are misunderstandings with the script. Again they are small things, but the very existence of that American navy is strange for the proposal of the anime. It seems a very convenient oblivion, for it should have been destroyed by impact.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTrue this anime has script conveniences, but not just him have script conveniences, every anime ever produced has conveniences. The problem of convenience is not to be something with a low probability of happening, it is contradicts something of the universe, if it comes out of nowhere, if it is something lazy, which is the case of Evangelion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally in this matter of art they could have explored more scenarios of this world, but the focus is almost always in the city, which is a pity, because they lost a good opportunity that even made more sense for the proposal of the anime, since it is a global threat. Thing that certainly did not help in world building, however was more convenient because it gave less work.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStory (03/10) <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is necessary to value in a script, a moral depth, a reflection, a good narrative, a good philosophical approach, some kind of knowledge or learning that can be taken. There are those who can see in the anime, but certainly there are no such things in this work, which is a psychological mess.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeginning with kabbalistic mysticism and elements of Christian theology. Yes, the anime makes use of it, which is good, is daring for the time, so it has become a landmark, but it is not the precursor of these elements in anime. The truth is they did not go into anything more than symbolically to give an excuse to have &quot;robots&quot; fighting giant monsters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe anime launches many mysteries, and making people think, what is good, but at some point should appear the answers, otherwise the work will be incomplete. A narrative full of loose ends is a bad narrative. He just does not respond to things like: Those angels need to be destroyed for what exactly? Why do the scrolls say it has to be that exact this number of angels? What happened to the characters in the end? What exactly happened on the first and second impacts? What happened to that spear? What is that spear? What is the purpose of that organization? What is the purpose of Shinji&#039;s father? Who are those people in the organization? Where did Adam and Lilith come from? Because only those born after the second impact can fly in an EVA? Why does not Shinji&#039;s father like him? How was that &quot;accident&quot; with Shinji&#039;s mother? Why did Shinji&#039;s mother &quot;killed himself&quot;? Why this liquid after impact? Among many other questions ...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPaying close attention can try to answer a few things with the anime. But first is paying a lot of attention, which is a narrative flaw, which is often incorrectly exalted, since the anime not knowing communicate right. And in second place is very vague. As an example: Where do those Angels come from? Adam&#039;s anime response. That&#039;s the answer! Does that answer like? And answer why? These are unsatisfactory responses, which only create more questions, the are only ones that can be obtained in the series. But someone can tell you that you have the movie and that they say something else about the angels. But what is said about the angels and Adam in the film is that they originate from Lilith and that men are angels, and that is all that is revealed. Think how the movie will answer something!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYes there is a movie that came later to try to answer some things, but it was practically an accident, it was not in the plans, so if this anime had not been successful they had ended without any response, not that the movie answers a lot, but it would be worse. Even because the film is not the end, it&#039;s episodes 25, and 26, the film virtually only chronicles the events prior to these episodes, it is not a continuation. It&#039;s not like they&#039;ll have another season later, and she&#039;ll explain. No, that&#039;s not it. It&#039;s a patch to close a hole, confessed and explicit. Therefore it is necessary to evaluate the works separately, and they separate do not close right.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn episode 24 there is an &quot;angel&quot; who wanted to die, so he quotes a phrase from the play Hamlet &quot;to be or not to be, that&#039;s the question.&quot; To be or not to be is to exist or not to exist, to live or to die. Prayer was not properly linked to the narrative context, so in the way it was approached the call to a phrase of effect was evident, only to make reference and deceive the uneducated. What they should have done was dig deeper into the whole question philosophically by showing the dilemma of the character in wanting to die, but the screen is static for almost three minutes playing a Mozart symphony. It&#039;s to keep your mouth open without believing they did it. Was it to stare at what? Was it for the staff to stay in doubt anxious if he was going to die? Oh really? Were they so out of money like that? It&#039;s false intellectualism in too much!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo make reference give a content yes, but if it is not worked, something is shallow, or if it is worked wrong it is something false, which is worse. The plot really does make some references, however it&#039;s shallow in content, yes they were broke, but that does not justify and that&#039;s not why we have to say it&#039;s good.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs for the alleged philosophies that the anime passes, well it can drink from various thinkers, but the issues is that they do not guide the work by almost two-thirds that are just a bang, without any deepening. But at the end where they are most discussed is it really deep? Not are they just psychological zucchini.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn relation to the AT fields, are soul fields (light of the soul) therefore only an EVA could hurt an angel and break those fields. What does not make sense is that they play Satan with guns, bombs and whatever you think of those monsters, but the type of rifles they use are very normal and they hurt the monsters. This is of course a plot hole, since conventional weapons theoretically do not work.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHas a plot problem right in the first episode, in relation to the escape of the protagonist of the city that was destroyed, it is difficult to swallow it. One hour he was in the middle of the city near the monster and another time was already far away, here comes a nuclear type bomb, detonates everything, the car he was getting destroyed, but he comes out unscathed. Soon afterwards comes the protagonist, who is an untrained child, in a &quot;robot&quot;, give a few blows and kills the monster. Does it make sense?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is also the question of cliches, which to some extent is reasonable, as long as they are improving, but if it is just copying others it is not good. Unfortunately it just copied the style, which is just the same even in the drawings of the monsters. The way a monster comes and destroys the city, comes the &quot;robot&quot; kills the monster, comes another episode, here comes another monster destroys the city, which should already be destroyed, but &quot;miraculously&quot; is not this, comes the robot again and so it goes. But it&#039;s not since 1995 when they did the anime, yet it&#039;s been since the 1960s, and in this case it&#039;s supersaturated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDialogues are often a tangle of psychological questions and answers. If someone asks a circle is round the first reaction is to ignore, if that person insist and repeat to the same question (need not be literally, it may be with other words), the reaction is of awe and watchful, if do this again will begin to question and theorize. Add to this a lot of bright lights and colors on a dark screen background causing a hypnosis. Then comes someone with an answer the sun is a ball, then again theorize, and even more this time about the question and the answer. Add to that a lot of flashbacks, cuts of scenes and screens with some letters that appear and reappear quickly. Do you know what this is? Nothing, but it&#039;s common for people to theorize not to accept that they were hearing something stupid. And by this time even those who are reading this must have forgotten what the question is, but the answer is still yes, the circle is round, obvious. Soon everything else was psychological zucchini.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe should not say that these forms of conversations that the anime presents are not an intelligent way of narrating, even though they are exhausted, but the questionings and responses of the dialogues are terrible. Sometimes the scenes are even beautiful, but it is a false Freudianism with force. Already the questions to which the people who are watching are made, and who really have connection with the development of the plot are ignored. The worst is that there are people who think this is spectacular and can see something deep there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNot to say that in the anime only has bad dialogue, if saved a logo in the beginning, between Shinji&#039;s father and Shinji, for his irreverence and suppression that causes, but complicates the plot. Or did not someone think he did not make the slightest sense in an hour like that the father is treating the boy badly? What sense does father have knowing that the world depends on his son, and even if he does not like the boy, he treats the boy so badly in that way, making him unstable in an hour like that? The scene is good but that is a hole in the script is.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe theme of the anime is Individuality vs. Collectivity. The individuality (Solitude) is treated in the anime almost always from a psychological point of view in the four main characters, but in a confused, shallow and negative way. Another point is that the theme is so hidden, mixed with other things that simply do not guide the work for most of the time, many people come until almost the last episode without knowing or are sure what the anime is about. The author may even have his reasons, but what is expected of a good work is that the subject be indicated from the beginning in an evident way giving its narrative focus, bringing to itself the central aspects of ideas and being developed clearly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the end it comes to the strangest thing of the work, which is about its theme. The individuality (solitude), fought and badly seen throughout the anime, in the end is the savior or not, depends only on the referential. This could be an interesting thing, but as the anime again leaves another loose end, and with so many others, it&#039;s just more confusion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCharacters (03/10) <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven if all the characters were good, they would not compensate Shinji who is a cowardly character. Not that we expected it to change from nothing, but in 26 episodes that there were some evolution, and wanting to give to make a great evolution, but what happens this more to an involution.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShinji&#039;s father was one of the most promising characters, unfortunately in the anime had little participation on screen, but was very good. Soon he was generally misused because he showed potential.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShinji&#039;s colleagues were initially worked the to first few episodes no reasons, as they were later underutilized and practically became extras. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAsuka became very popular, so it became the standard for all tsunderes, even though there are those who claim that it is not a tsundere, but it has become the standard and can not refute this argument. Coming out of the archetype of her personality she has a few layers, but it did not come to be a major construction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Rei, another character who became standard, in the case that is for Kuuderes, and has a little more layers than Asuka. But in the anime it has no ego of its own, does what it says, showing little self-awareness, little individuality, and that too is also a lack of a layer. In the movie is another story, but it is not to be rated together.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClones, which are more extravagant than anything, are easily deductible their existence, but the revelation of who the plugs are and the scene of destruction has surely added to the plot.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMisato is a major who in this apocalyptic world is walking in sexy clothes all the time, with children&#039;s dialogues and behavior, such as tongue-giving. She also flirts or gets drunk in almost every scene, and her main activity is to be a kind of nanny. Is something wrong there? Has anyone seen an absurdity, an incoherence? Was not it meant to please a certain audience?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlready the scene of Misato&#039;s most appealing fanservice is surprising because they had the courage to make it detailed in that way, maybe that&#039;s why it was so good, even though it was censored and stayed only in audio.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA little more about the protagonist anticlimactic, passive, weak and perverted. He has achieved the feat of becoming even more unpleasant in the final stretch, he is simply the worst character in all anime. True that the reason generally to watch is not this personage, but if do not have a reason it will be only to hope that it dies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt really is very difficult and daring to work with Shinji type character. An unpleasant character that helps to detonate the work, but that may be interesting in some cases. The problem is that Shinji&#039;s personality for Neon Genesis Evangelion has almost no meaningful plotting function, which is critical to the interesting use of such characters. Proof of this is that they could put a more charismatic personality and would not change the story at all, thus making like this the Sinji just an obnoxious element. To be lonely, do not have to be a coward and a fool.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso have to recognize that at no time and even if do not like Shinji can it be said that it is poorly constructed, or that it has no layers. But being well-built does not necessarily mean that he is a good character, and not only because of his charisma, but because of the function in the work of certain characteristics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSomeone may say that Shinji is good because it has become a reference, but it is not necessarily for good things, like Mirai Nikki&#039;s Yuki and Accel World&#039;s Haruyuki who were inspired by Shinji. In fact it was reference for all the animes that has protagonists bad and hated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, why on earth did Shinji have to be the one chosen to fly an EVA? It was necessary to be less than 14 years old, but why not any other boy who could or maybe wanted and even had training? And there are only three post-second children in this universe? Why had not they trained him before, since they had been waiting for the angel for so many years? Is not that convenient for the fact that this happens soon to the son of the big boss? But in the game, in the movie, in the manga, stop that is a hole, and even with the &quot;justifications&quot; that came later from his mother, still does not justify almost any of these questions. Then there are still people who complains about convenient scripts and puts Neon Genesis Evangelion at the top of the list!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnjoyment (03/10) <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe emotions that the anime go through give a stimulus in some episodes, but the excitement lasts very little. During almost all the anime is without great climaxes, soon the end that already is tedious is shown much more difficult to watch. Do not give to cry with this anime, also do not laugh, the only strong thing that is really desirable when watching is to end soon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe motivation to see an anime of this size can be several, but when you like it, having time and being good, it usually ends quickly. It is not the case of Evangelion that it is almost impossible to watch all at once. This is not an expected thing for a good anime, a good anime needs to conquer and make people anxious to want the next episode instead.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeveral episodes simply give a lot of sleep, being a real struggle not to sleep, however this point is not valid for all episodes, there are some more interesting than others.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverall (03/10) <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRecommended by many as great, a cult work, references to several other animes, but it&#039;s a big disappointment. The fact is that if are not a person enjoying the episodic style Power Rangers will have agony with more than 15 episodes of similar content and saturated. The rest of the plot is filled with hollow dialogs saying nothing to anything. But the worst is that there are people who do not understand, and see things where there is not. The ending is simply a bunch of psychological zucchini with parts of past episodes, because in fact they had not thought of an ending, and also had no money, but were forced to finalize. Soon they had no respect for the public, and kind of unwillingly played anything just to end.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe final claim of the fans is that the play is wonderful because the author is depressive and he wanted to show depression in the anime. He really got me depressed with such a bad thing!\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286742" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286742">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286742"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286742">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286742" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286742" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

Today I&#039;ll be reviewing Berserk 2016, the masterpiece with plot so unique and unpredictable it will keep you on the edge of your seats for 12 episodes straight. The amazing and complex characters will take your breath away as you fall in love with each and every one of them. Absolute 10/10.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story is about a guy named Guts (Gats-kun) who is probably the best character for the average viewer to insert himself into I&#039;ve seen so far in anime. The guy has absolutely no special features or whatsoever. Normal\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286741">\n        build, MC haircut, generic voice, even his clothes look boring, honestly. Like if this was an actual RPG this would&#039;ve been the default level 1 male character. It is almost like Kentarou Miura is trying to tell their audience full of 30-year-old virgins &quot;If this guy can do it, everyone can! Don&#039;t lose hope guys!&quot;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Oh come on, no one watches Berserk for the guy anyway. Gimme girls, gimme rape.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWell, there is no actual rape (which is probably the only redeeming feature). The girls... Oh... Did I say girl&quot;S&quot;? Well, there was just one girl with three different heads because the budget for this one was probably so low they couldn&#039;t even afford changing their height or breast size a little. And how there is no rape you ask? Well, it&#039;s quite simple. All of the girls are in love with our amazing protagonist even though they are sisters and aware of the fact that he sleeps with all three of them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Characters, plot... you are talking too much, this is Berserk remember? No one really cares about that stuff, I just want to fap, that&#039;s all.&quot;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYes, but it will be kinda hard for you to do so, because on top of all Griffith probably has the most boring sex scenes I&#039;ve seen in a while. And it&#039;s not because the censorship or the awful animation and voice acting. The creativity in this one was close to 0, just 12 episodes of complete emptiness. It&#039;s hard to distinguish one sex scene from the others. Even the most hardcore vanilla fan will probably fall asleep unless he starts thinking about his ex or smh.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStory: 1,<br />\r\nArt: 4,<br />\r\nSound: 3,<br />\r\nCharacter: 0,<br />\r\nEnjoyment: not found<br />\r\nOverall: 3D&gt;2D <br />\r\nGriffith is an asshole.\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286741" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286741">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286741"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286741">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286741" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286741" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

But that&#039;s just my taste, others may find them very good looking.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main characters immediately caught my attention and I hope a lot more will be revealed about them later on in the anime. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt&#039;s isn&#039;t much of a comedy anime, it&#039;s very serious and violent, but there are a few funny moments that made me laugh.<br />\r\nI like how this anime is more or less based on how the world works in some bigger cities, and I do learn quite a lot from that, what each group (gang) of people go through and what their actions are towards others.<br />\r\nIt&#039;s a mysterious anime and I like that. I like the dark and violence in it, that&#039;s just me though.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI&#039;m gonna update this review as I watch the incoming episodes that are being aired once a week. <br />\r\nKeep it up!\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286740" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286740">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286740"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286740">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286740" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286740" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

In the case of the anime industry, when a work has a high budget, people behind it can go a little bit wild in forming their ideas and emotions onto the screen. In contrast, when they are short on funds and/or urgently want their product to sell, they use numerous slick marketing techniques and don&#039;t put too much effort into crafting the product. Now you may ask: &quot;But what does it have to do with Darling in the FranXX? It doesn&#039;t suffer from a low budget, nor it tries to\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286739">\n        sell itself with little to no effort.&quot; While the first part of that sentence may be right, I cannot agree with the second one.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou see, accurately called by some people, Cucking in the FranXX is a collab between two extremely well-known studios, A-1 Pictures, which over the years has produced quite a number of controversial titles, and Trigger, founded by ex-Gainax employees and recognised for its bizarre and lively art style. Wait, so people who worked at Gainax are here? Yes, Hiroyuki Imaishi is here and so is Atsushi Nishigori, as the director. Just why?! Why would you place a guy who might have a fair understanding when it comes down to animation, haha, his character designs are pretty darn good, but has a directional knowledge that doesn&#039;t go beyond &quot;Yeah, I directed iDOLM@STER&quot; as the man in charge? I mean, just look at the first episode, 22 minutes of HIS sole work. It was written entirely by him and do you know what? It&#039;s terrible. Our main duo and their future relationship are presented in the banalest and one-dimensional way possible. We get the first glimpse of Hiro&#039;s personality through some tedious dialogues of other characters and not his character-defining actions and Zero Two&#039;s first encounter with him, quite certainly, had to have a sexual background, because why not? Toss in some titties! Oh, don&#039;t forget to make them fuck and do some batshit crazy stuff in a mecha, by the end of the episode. Mission accomplished, characters are (not) established! Don&#039;t you worry though as this fantastic and slick writing continues till the very end! Imagine a bowl filled with dough, ready to be merged with the ingredients necessary for baking the quality cake, but instead of said elements, what gets thrown inside is, literally, anything that lies nearby. That&#039;s how this show, genuinely, progresses. It began as a story concentrated around the sex symbolism, i.e. all of this piloting mechas in doggy style position and camera angles straight on a girl&#039;s ass bullshit. I like to call this section in FranXX&#039;s construction as &quot;The horny period&quot; as it baits potential viewers with its lewd imagery and themes. Then, it developed into a full-on teen drama with a little bit of NTR sprinkled on top since, you know, there are characters besides the main duo in this anime! It pretended to be a coming-of-age tale while treating its characters with remarkably passive writing that they came off as lifeless and rigid.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd here&#039;s the deal. Every single character in this show is a walking talking archetype, no matter how much time people behind this show put into these teenagers. Futoshi is the obese guy, Ichigo is the childhood female friend that falls in love with the protagonist because... Zero Two needs an empty love adversary, Goro is the nice guy who gets cucked, Zorome is the hyperactive one, Kokoro is the additional sexually frustrated hoe, Ikuno is the hollow anal type of a character, Mitsuru is the cocky lad and Miku is the enthusiastic girl. I just described the entire cast in full detail with the use of a few words. Situations, where these fellow individuals are given some kind of a turn, are not rare, in fact, they are there to remind us that, hey, these characters actually exist, I know, that&#039;s shocking, but they are resolved and forgotten in a span of AT MAX 2 episodes. Oh, does Futoshi have bulimia for some stupid reason? Remind him that he has to eat, problem solved. Oh, there&#039;s someone called Ikuno and she&#039;s the most transparent out of all the cardboard cutouts? SHIT! Better throw in some lesbian action without foreshadowing it! Oh, is Mitsuru over his gay-ish fantasies? SHIT! Better make him the love interest of Kokoro and kill 2 birds with one stone! Do these situations add an extra layer to these characters? No, they do not. Honestly, they exist for the sole purpose of not making these guys so forgettable that even the simplest of the viewer doesn&#039;t give a damn about them by the end of the episode.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd thus, we come to the last section in Darling in the FranXX, the okay-ish worldbuilding episode and the big alien invasion. *cough* &quot;How do we keep our viewers interested in the series till the end? The popularity of the series has gone down drastically with its progression, please think of something! how about we just throw in some alien bullshit? Brilliant!!&quot; I imagine that was the thinking process behind these few episodes. Out of fricking nowhere, we get an alien invasion? Was it foreshadowed? No. Was it built up in any logical sense? No. Does it make sense? No. And do you know why this whole thing was arranged? Because the space elements worked in Gurren Lagann, so it&#039;s assured that they will work here too... right? You see, I didn&#039;t mention it before, but... this series takes EVERY SINGLE INTERESTING PLOT ELEMENT from Gurren Lagann and Neon Genesis Evangelion. What&#039;s that? A theme of youth and growing up, the main and fantastically executed and humane theme of Gurren Lagann? Let&#039;s take it and screw it up here because why not? What&#039;s that? Changing from a typical monster of the week type of a narrative into an absolute psychological feast, which was done in Neon Genesis Evangelion flawlessly? Guess what? FranXX borrows that structure but instead of psychological intricacies, it offers a horrific teenager drama with no emotional weight behind it. The list goes on and on! A copycat of SEELE? Check. Tokyo-3/Geofront inspired underground cities? Check. Are klaxosaurs a hybrid of the spirals and angels? Check. HOW BRILLIANT! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut, do you know what&#039;s even better than the broken narrative of FranXX? Its splinter that got stuck underneath my skin so many goddamn months ago - Zero Two. At this point, it should be more than apparent that I absolutely hate her. If you saw me at least once on the MAL forums, you would notice me with a caricature of her disgusting face. All of my seemingly &quot;unreasonable&quot; hatred for her person can be summarised in one single sentence: She&#039;s an abhorrent character because she&#039;s not a character, dang it, she&#039;s not even a damn plot device like Biba from Kabaneri or any other 0-dimensional &quot;villain&quot; ; she&#039;s a tool used to sell this monstrosity of a show. She was created to play the role of the &quot;best&quot; character in the entire anime and to exclude others from being important, worth remembering or straight up existing in the eyes of an average Joe watching FranXX. Unmistakably, this anime&#039;s appalling writing played an important role in making the supporting characters paper thin, but look at her character design and compare it to that of Squad 13&#039;s members. Did you spot it? Every single fellow beside her owns a bland grey uniform, while our dear female wears a distinctive and eye-catching red coat, heck, even her parasite suit bares the same colour with the addition of heels, heck x2, even her face and hair are way more &quot;defined&quot;, which furtherly distances her from others. Pretty much the same thing applies to her personality. While it&#039;s extremely annoying and hyperfocused on the concept of stealing the hearts of cucks without breaking a sweat, stands as the only recognisable one. Not for long though, as she went from the obnoxious horny waifu bait tool to the shallow and unbelievably artificial waifu bait tool due to her consistent character shifts. Here, let me explain how she developed over the course of this series with this: &quot;Hey, I&#039;m 12-year-olds&#039; wet dream&quot; &amp;gt; &quot;im a monster :(&quot; &amp;gt; &quot;I&#039;m over it :D darling :3 :D&quot; &amp;gt; &quot;b-but im a monster :(&quot;. Ugh, even her relationship with Hiro, which, NEWS FLASH, is the primary focus of the story comes off as toxic and fake. Well, that&#039;s what happens when you combine a generic self-insert cuck, who&#039;s an empty seashell with gold sprayed on top with the most hurtful, for the viewer that desires high quality, marketing method: a horny and futile waifu bait that will easily sell merchandise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, for something a little bit more positive, let&#039;s stray from this road of complete agony and take a look at the production values. Visually, this anime looks good and stable for the majority of the times. I won&#039;t gonna lie, as much as I don&#039;t like... anything in this show, I have to give FranXX credit for its fighting scenes. It may be devoid of any personality, but damn, the fluidly animated battles (I&#039;m talking about the mech fights, not the god awful space LotGH stylised battles) are darn good. The backgrounds, stills and colours are more or less decent. Aurally, meh, it leaves much to be desired.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, did I enjoy Darling in the FranXX? Well, franxxly, HELL NO. This show has been such a frustrating nuance since the very beginning. Dear Lord, merely hearing and seeing Zero Two made me want to gouge my eyes out. Mangling your goddamn story didn&#039;t enhance the viewing experience. What a surprise! I would describe this atrocity in 2 words; cringy and pretentious. Adding the flavourless bird symbolism and the poorly executed theme of dualism and colour theory rather than supplementing the plot, made this anime look like its trying to be more profound than it is in reality. Oh, you like when the symbolism and subtle themes are well incorporated into the narrative and aren&#039;t &quot;into your face&quot;? Guess what? You will want to puke next time you see one of these. B-but the fights look nice! So what? Do they bear any meaning? Hell no. There&#039;s no emotional weight behind any of these. Why should I care about characters creators themselves do not care about? But the director said that he wanted the characters to remain human till the very end. Haha, guess what? They weren&#039;t humane, to begin with.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUh, let&#039;s be FranXX, this show sucks on every single level imaginable. It&#039;s as devoid of motion, emotion and heart as humanly possible. If you want to see a good waifu material, stick to shows that truly care about their personality. As for me, I will try to erase my memory of this abomination... by stabbing myself in the temple.

Many cartoons have adopted the art style, direction and humour from classic anime to present their story; that&#039;s why many people worship the importance of anime in pop culture. That being said, is weird seeing anime taking inspiration from cartoons; it just not something that appeals to  the common anime demographic, especially because these always turn out to be an interpretation of the western culture instead of a way to accentuate or elevate the concept as a whole.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis however, cannot be applied to Panty and Stocking With Garterbelt.\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286738">\n        Even the name has this ridiculous double entendre that pretty much describes the zaniness and quirckiness of the show. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPanty and Strocking follows the two titular characters, a pair of angels with a racy behaviour that are buying there way back to heaven being guided by Garterbelt, an over the top priest. They all locate this creatures known as ghosts to cleanse Earth from evil. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story itself takes the structure of a normal cartoon, with one episode having two different segments each one with a different plot. This works for the advantage of the show, because it allows for more self contained stories that can be put in their own different canon; allowing for really creative stories along its run. The problem with these structure is that almost all of the development is taken away from the characters, the last moments of the show being the exception. This is a huge misunderstanding of cartoons, because even the ones made for kids use development to the strenght of the plots. All in all, the story isn&#039;t the most attractive thing in the world but it&#039;s execution through the offensive yet playful dialogue is masterfully done, the banter between the characters and the way they interact with each other is both clever and funny on its own. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough the writing can be quite funny at times, it can also stumble in some pretty clich\xc3\xa9 ideas overused in 90 percent of cartoons. It can also be, to put it plainly, quite disguting at times; using farts, vomit and other shit like that as focal points for an episode. Other major flaw of the show, is the lack of interest it presents on turning its two main characters into something likeable, it&#039;s pretty common feeling as if the show was trying to make you hate the pair because of their horrible behaviour towards the poeple around them which can get annoying in some parts of the show where the issues they&#039;re dealing could be solved easily if they weren&#039;t complete assholes, trait that is emphisized by the limited traits the pair has.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStrangely enough, that doesn&#039;t stop the show of being really entertaining. Besides the quirky dialogue, the show packs a really stylized art that&#039;s oozing with some style(see the main characters for further proof). Every frame in the show comes to life using some visual onomatopeia and using an attractive combination of colours. This is accentuated, or ruined depending on how you see it,  with a smooth change of art styles throughout the episodes or segments (with varying levels of quality), which can make the art feel a bit inconsitent. The only department where the art can be guilty of being poor is during some of the animation sequences that look either rushed or unfinished. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen the art department and the animation sync in the right way, the show can be a blast to watch and it gives the audience the show&#039;s most memorable sequences, each accompanied by an ost inspired by Jpop that, while it&#039;s limited, it&#039;s quite delightful in it&#039;s own right. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn conclusion, when the pieces are working well together the show can be an exciting and really entertaing show just to watch but due to technical limitations caused by a really apparent low budget, some poor writing decisions and characterization. That being said, if you want an anime with a unique style and an accelerated pace, and can handle racy or flat out gross writing or imagery; you&#039;ll probably enjoy Panty And Stocking With Garterbelt. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286738" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286738">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286738"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286738">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286738" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286738" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

does not live up to the primary work in the slightest. to me, it was nothing but a huge disappointment. i&#039;ll agree that it is indeed normal for anime based on visual novels to be poorly adapted. however, &quot;enzai&quot; takes bad adaptation to a whole new level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nfirst off, the animation.<br />\r\n3/10<br />\r\nit sucks, that is the best way to put it. the original visual novel artwork was drawn by yura, who were on their early years of activity and were not nearly as skilled\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286737">\n        as of today, consequently their drawings did not have much detail. nevertheless, they were graphic enough for the game&#039;s grotesque theme and could capture the respective scenes&#039; emotion and meaning with ease. the anime cannot. even if animated scenes have less effort put into them than still drawings, it seems like the whole process of bringing guys and his story to life was rushed and made below par. there are unusual anatomy sins and just an unpleasant look overall. i know the whole project and its concept is not supposed to be good looking, yet my face was crooked with disgust throughout the entirety of the two episodes, and not because of the rape scenes for i was used to them. it could be so much better.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nonto the characters.<br />\r\n4/10<br />\r\nit&#039;s good they have maintained the aura of most characters in this animation. countering that, they have changed many attributes about other ones. although this was a 2 episode ova, there was much more to add to the good adaptations of characters and much more to improve and clear up. we got no backstory except for a quarter of vallewida&#039;s and a hint of the past relationship between evan and lusca, maybe a few minutes of guildias and myuca as well. guys&#039; family is nowhere to be seen apart from a cameo appearance of his mother at his judgment. guildias doesn&#039;t look as evil as he&#039;s supposed to. io couldn&#039;t be more of an extra. bollanet just went missing, apparently. lusca just looks like an imposter trying to pass as a lawyer to take cash from poor, and is no longer that uninterested alcoholic that you struggle so much to put up with and captivate in the game. at most, he is just an airhead. vallewida just seems like a lunatic, which is personally tragic to me since he is my favourite character from the game. there&#039;s no explanation about him whatsoever. and durer, oh durer. the one character that made the game so hard for me to swallow. they seem to have tried so hard to make him act as sadistic as possible, it just seems forced at some point in the game. it is not candid anymore. those are just to name a few. there is zero explanation as to why everyone is in that prison and just a small pinch of their personalities is shown, therefore no one is really likeable. unlike the visual novel, it is boring to watch them trying to contribute to the story. the &quot;who is he? what is he going to do? is he good or evil?&quot; feeling is gone and i miss it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nthe plot.<br />\r\n5/10<br />\r\nit is the same, thankfully, but good part of it was cut off and replaced with free sex. the ending seems so random due to the lack of answers it hurts to watch. one of the goals of &quot;enzai&quot; as a game was to show the many horrors men in prison are constantly exposed to, and the visual novel managed to do it well enough. the anime spares half the effort, though. would be a 0/10 if it didn&#039;t follow the original storyline.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nthe voice acting.<br />\r\n7/10<br />\r\ni can&#039;t say this has fully disappointed me. most of the voice actors are the same ones from the game. they are very good at their job, especially guildias and vallewida&#039;s. their voices are rich in emotion and very loyal to each moment they are voicing. since the plot involves a lot of forced sex, they have to be very skilled at portraying specific traits such as humiliation and guilt. the atmosphere of the anime managed to ruin their competence for me, though. sadly, i could not enjoy it as much.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nthe sexual content.<br />\r\n2/10<br />\r\none of the biggest downsides of this anime. in the original work, there are much more sex scenes and some are, indeed, random and even unnecessary. however, they are full of emotion. during all the times guildias abuses the imprisoned men, you can feel all of their shame, how much they dread being there, etc. either if it is through their voices, the drawings or the text from the game. in the anime, though, it is just free rape. many of the scenes in the &quot;enzai&quot; game actually have a rather deep meaning and a more intense shock factor, yet the studio decides to adapt the most generic ones. you can grasp the concept of each scene and take it as you will, but the novel&#039;s ability of making you feel sorry for the characters being there has nearly vanished. on top of that, all of the sexual scenes are short, poorly animated and painful. have an idea of what i&#039;m talking about: some of those scenes from the game made me cry. some of those same scenes, in the anime, were genuinely funny to watch because of how ridiculous they&#039;ve become.<br />\r\n<br />\r\noverall: 3/10.<br />\r\nit is not a good anime, nor a good adaptation. it is distasteful. should you look forward to see a story set in a napoleonic france about a boy and the horrors he lives in prison, i highly suggest the game instead of this... thing. the game is plain, detailed and nicely done, opposing the anime. it wholeheartedly surprises me that the langmaor team themselves have supervised the entire project. again, it has deeply disappointed me as a fan and i could point at many things i would like to see fixed. in the end, though, it&#039;s just another bad game adaptation. &quot;enzai&quot; had a lot of potential to become an anime as successful as the game, but it all went down the drain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\ni would not recommend this to anyone at all.\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286737" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286737">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286737"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286737">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286737" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286737" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

Let&#039;s try to unpack how and why.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStory<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst thing is first, the story: It&#039;s a mess that doesn&#039;t really go anywhere.  We&#039;re introduced to this world, menaced by a (presumably, nothing is ever confirmed) alien life-form called Savages.  The opening scene is actually a rather gruesome attack on a city by a giant monster.  Nothing ever really lives up to this again.  We see a survivor of that attack attending a military school for using super-power tech to fight said monsters.  That&#039;s alright so far, but... We have the amazing \xe2\x80\x9cspecial\xe2\x80\x9d who hasn&#039;t done\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286733">\n        anything yet, and quickly find out that the inmates here are running the asylum with a student council president able to expel students and willing to resolve disputes with a duel.  Ouch.  We also meet our girl-disguised-as-a-boy and the other survivor of the opening scene so obvious winner of the harem to be and I&#039;m so glad this bit has a running time beyond two seconds of tolerance.  They don&#039;t even really try to fake us out, anyone with two brain cells to rub together could know what&#039;s going on.  But OK, let&#039;s say you take all this in stride.  They&#039;re chucking the dark atmosphere and potential intensity suggested by the opening, but that leaves a Super-powered high school antics show, right?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWell, it sort of drops the school aspect (no one ever attends class or spends time in a school-like environment; it&#039;s just an excuse for all the characters to be improbably young), and while you might find some of the initial mission fighting promising (I didn&#039;t \xe2\x80\x93 the action in this show isn&#039;t anywhere above par) for just... harem nonsense with a side of fighting the same exact monster in different size categories repeatedly?  That&#039;s not compelling, though they spend some of this time introducing the show&#039;s \xe2\x80\x9cbest\xe2\x80\x9d character (an easily won superlative) in its \xe2\x80\x9cmost effective\xe2\x80\x9d (again...) moments, so maybe you think that&#039;s OK?  It&#039;s not good though, surely there must be more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe show helpfully introduces (by reputation) a figure who seems like she could be a decent villain, and a bad guy team on the same side.  So, OK, it sucks that we&#039;re not really doing anything with the Savages, but at least these jokers will actually do some plot lifting?  Unfortunately, they kind of don&#039;t: more time is devoted to spouting exposition and accidental-boob-grab humor than on actually forming a coherent plot or generating real investment.  If the show was better done I guess team black-and-yellow could have seemed mysterious, but I have no reason to want to solve their mystery.  We&#039;re told they&#039;re looting valuable stuff and that they&#039;re working for a mad scientist sort of figure, but without motivation or investment in the characters (the show&#039;s biggest fault) you can&#039;t really get involved with the mystery because there are no stakes for the viewer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat follows are two more arcs of junk: Bad action sequences, lackluster humor, and talking solely about &#039;what&#039; rather than &#039;who&#039; or &#039;why&#039; doesn&#039;t string together into anything coherent.  The final arc is really emblematic of the show&#039;s problems, since nothing is built up or set up well.  The Mad Scientist Villain from before is finally revealed and does things, but we aren&#039;t clued in on what she&#039;s doing or why she&#039;s doing it before hand, so the damage from her attacks just seems senseless... as little of it as there is.  Nobody gets really hurt throughout this show (except maybe one guard who in one shot seemed very dead, but later there was no blood anymore so who knows?) and few enough people are legitimately imperiled that you don&#039;t really get a sense of danger or consequences that carry the action on.  You can have your characters get through their battles and be alright, but you need to sell up their foes so the audience can suspend disbelief and feel like maybe this is the time they&#039;re going to really suffer or die.  Hundred never gives enough effort to let that drama exist outside of, again, that opening flashback.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEventually we do get a motive for the villain... that was never set up and thus didn&#039;t have any emotional impact since it relies on spouting facts about characters we&#039;ve barely met rather than expressing the emotions of those we know.  And then the Villain is unceremoniously disposed of with a lot of the final episode left just cleaning up minions.  The big climax doesn&#039;t even (directly) involve her at all, but rather the emotional turmoil of a tertiary character we never really got to know as addressed by the main character who shared maybe two lines on screen with said tertiary character.  Oh, yeah, that&#039;s enough to form a strong bond with both each other and the audience that legitimizes a \xe2\x80\x9cpower of friendship saves the day\xe2\x80\x9d moment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLong story short, the story is horrible.  It never once lands its moments or justifies its existence.  It could have gone a lot of ways \xe2\x80\x93 it could have been a grim battlefield like Attack on Titan, an emotional roller coaster like Darling in the Franxx, or a slice of over the top insanity like Kill la Kill, but instead it did... Absolutely nothing worth doing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArt<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe animation is... OK at best.  Most of the designs look fine, though the \xe2\x80\x9cBasic Savage\xe2\x80\x9d is heavily reused and some of the characters seem far too exaggerated for the show to take itself fully seriously without ever utilizing or acknowledging the fanservice aspects like Kill la Kill or Darling in the Franxx did.  There are a lot of cut corners, especially as the show reaches towards its climax, so either they didn&#039;t have the budget to execute their vision or, seeing how little of a vision there seems to be in the scenes that try, they just didn&#039;t care.  Most damningly, the action isn&#039;t fluid or engaging.  Good action especially, and good animation in general, is predicated on a certain level of dynamism.  You need shots that sell the events on screen as being meaningful or having weight to them, and you need shots that provide enough of a rush with their speed and clarity that the viewer can get sucked into what&#039;s going on and actually experience it.  Hundred managed, once or twice, to actually sell an event (like someone crashing into a wall selling the monster&#039;s strength), but it never managed to actually be engaging.  The best fight scenes in the show were sharp and choppy, where the strikes were too sudden to really follow in a meaningful fashion or too consumed by bright light to actually see what&#039;s going on.  It&#039;s a cop-out, in my mind, to avoid having to come up with actual good choreography.  More fight scenes relied on slow pans over still images of an attack or impact, maybe with something in the scene spinning or fluttering to give the illusion of motion.  It would be pretty terrible if this was just the battles, but other important scenes, that should be sweeping but could afford to be slower and more controlled (like a big and plot-critical concert) use the same technique.  For heaven&#039;s sake they repeatedly use pans over character art for those characters singing, and their mouths don&#039;t even move, it&#039;s transparently still.  Even if the concept art looks alright, I&#039;d like a little more animation in my animation, please.  I remember other shows, like Fullmetal Alchemist (2003) and Record of Lodoss War getting cheap in similar ways, but typically they actually had a few spectacles they were saving their budget for (or had blown it on).  Hundred, again, never really does anything worth doing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven the art, while potentially on the good edge of bog standard, suffers for the show&#039;s lack of vision: even when it&#039;s pretty, there&#039;s no creativity to it.  Let&#039;s take the Hundreds themselves as an example.  Here, the show has a good setup to impress visually, since every character who uses a Hundred has at least two, potentially three &#039;forms&#039; they can work with: the basic character (in their fancy Zero Suit), the character transformed by their Hundred, and for some characters a second level of transformation into a truly unique and overpowered form.  Hundred puts two of its main characters through their paces in the second episode and... wow it&#039;s not impressive.  I can kind of forgive the first level of transformation being gaining a couple metal plates and a weapon \xe2\x80\x93 the show wants to maintain its fanservice to some degree and while the designs aren&#039;t creative or intricate I accept that there&#039;s a reason for that.  Not a good reason, but a reason.  But then the second level transformations kick in, and this should really be a chance to wow us \xe2\x80\x93 this step is built up as rare and powerful, so it ought to look amazing.  What happens?  The main character gets a visor and a slightly bigger weapon.  The female character pulling out the same technique gets slightly fancier boots and a moderately bigger weapon.  They aren&#039;t even different weapons that are bigger than the original, they&#039;re just scaled up slightly.  A chance to do something amazing was practically gift-wrapped for this show and... nothing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSound<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI can&#039;t complain too much about the sound.  It&#039;s not good, and while at times I feel the voice actors were poorly directed for the scenes I&#039;d cover that more in character.  I do kind of want to knock it down for sprouting a music theme (this show throws a lot of stuff at the wall, and none of it sticks because I think they treated it as a competition for how many cliches they could cram into 12 episodes) and then not delivering actually impressive music, but what they do deliver isn&#039;t bad.  It&#039;s mediocre all around, but I can&#039;t really say any of the performances were godawful and the sound effects and background music never really distracted or detracted from the show.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCharacter<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThen we come to the biggest failing of this show, worse even than the plot: its characters.  At its heart, Hundred is a harem anime (or at least that&#039;s what&#039;s left when it already failed at action and mystery), and for anyone who&#039;s at least a little discerning and doesn&#039;t just want to ogle the drawings, a show with harem elements lives and dies on how good or bad its characters are.  Good shows that are harem-types or have a decent amount of harem in them have memorable, creative characters with distinctive personalities.  Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches, Steins;Gate, and KonoSuba could all be classified as at least partially Harem, and they all take their time developing their leading ladies and getting the viewer to know them as people so, even in the cases where the \xe2\x80\x9cwinner\xe2\x80\x9d is a foregone conclusion (Which, by the way, it didn&#039;t have to be in Hundred, despite them choosing the obvious lazy route in the end), you can like all the contenders and maybe even root for an off-route.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHundred has three main \xe2\x80\x9cheroines\xe2\x80\x9d and none of them ever really land.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst is Emile (or, Emilia), a the girl-disguised-as-a-boy from the opening flashback.  And... that&#039;s about it.  She&#039;s generically affectionate, clingy, and jealous.  There&#039;s really nothing else to her, she&#039;s got the personality of damp cardboard.  There&#039;s no comedy potential in the character once her one gag has worn out its brief welcome because she doesn&#039;t act in a manner that&#039;s consistent enough to either use or subvert, there&#039;s no drama potential in the character because the only facts about her are played for &#039;humor&#039;, and she doesn&#039;t even have any connection to the plot.  In terms of story, you could cut this character, probably the character who gets the second most screen time (though the three leading ladies are closer than you&#039;d expect out of such a sloppy production, to the point of being given nearly equal weight so that &#039;resolving&#039; the harem feels like a cop-out at the end), and nothing of value would be lost.  Seriously, replace her with an otherwise inanimate scarecrow that possesses equivalent combat abilities, and that at least would be a little funny because hey, this character is an inanimate scarecrow and no one seems to be noticing.  Most damningly, despite theoretically having this powerful background with the main character (enough to blow your opening scene on) they have literally no chemistry.  It&#039;s actually kind of amazing, they&#039;re like Helium and Neon, just incapable of reacting.  Other than her acting kind of like a clingy girlfriend (despite the fact that she should be taking her \xe2\x80\x9cpretend to be a boy\xe2\x80\x9d ruse that exists for basically no reason seriously) she shares nothing with the main character.  They never talk about anything or express what makes them happy, they never bond over current events, even the history they theoretically share from that first scene is mentioned maybe once, and then only to explain how they both became \xe2\x80\x9cspecial\xe2\x80\x9d tier fighters, not to build any emotional connection between them as characters.  Did I mention she&#039;s also a princess?  Yeah, I guess you could classify that a spoiler but it&#039;s given about as much weight in show as I just gave it right now, and doesn&#039;t help her character in the least.  We still have no reason why she and main character should feel each other to be more than passing acquaintances, which is the worst possible result for the supposed romantic winner.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSecond we have Claire, the Student Council President/Boss of Everything.  She&#039;s generically tsundere (just a little), clingy, and jealous.  She&#039;s got a little more going for her than Emile did, since she at least has a personality (even if it&#039;s not a good one) and one or two scenes where she actually talks to the main character like they&#039;re human beings (though it takes to episode 8 to see), as well as a connection (however weak) to what passes for a plot in this show.  She mostly seems to exist for fanservice shots, but I&#039;ll grant her that she at least pretends to have more than breasts and spouting exposition to her.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSakura, the third and final serious contender, is the only character who made a connection predicated on emotion and character, on WHO she is rather than WHAT she is.  The fact that she&#039;s alone in this is a really damning truth for the show.  Like Emile, she has history with the Main Character (in fact, dating to the same event), but unlike Emile this actually leaves an impact on both of them as people: Sakura is a big-time singer, and got her love of singing from having spent time with the Main Character and his little sister when they were in a bad situation together, and the fact that she could make people happy.  Meanwhile, Main Character is able to connect better with his sister in part over that memory.  She&#039;s still generically affectionate, clingy, and jealous for most of her run time, but she actually does have motivation and emotion leading her to do what she does in the show and with her life in the background.  She manages to be the instigating actor for the second of the show&#039;s four arcs, which is more relevance than even Claire really had in the end, and along with the previously mentioned little sister (who idolized her without knowing it was the girl she met years ago) is the vehicle for delivering the music theme.  She also has some pretty heavy background with the villain, having been used as a guinea pig for mad science experiments by said baddie.  And when her history comes out, the scene with the Main Character is actually given a little weight and meaning.  Why the hell was this show not about her? She has wants and desires, she has strong ties to both the heroic and villainous side of the plot, she&#039;s core to one of the show&#039;s way too many themes... Emile could vanish and Sakura could fairly effortlessly take over her sad excuse for a role (minus the \xe2\x80\x9cpretending to be a boy\xe2\x80\x9d stupidity) entirely.  No one would miss Emile.  Before it seems like I&#039;m praising her too much, let me be clear: Sakura stands out in this show not because she&#039;s a good character in her own right, but because she&#039;s the only character here who hits basic competence for any sort of character writing.  Like I mentioned, she&#039;s fairly generic, and while her connection to the little sister actually gets built on, her connection to the villain is the first mention of the villain and then... never comes up in the climax.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn my mind, Hundred wouldn&#039;t have been saved by retooling to present Sakura as the female lead, but it sure as hell would have been a step in the right direction: she has the better used history with the main character, she and the main character get along as people in the present even without that, she has decent plot magnetism at multiple stages, and she could even be used in the ending: when the main character has to use the power of friendship to reach a former guinea pig of the sadly disposed of villain, that could have been the power of love for Sakura instead, having used her past as a mad science experiment to generate a real threat.  Then, at least, the character in jeopardy would have been one we actually felt for, and the bond that needed to be utilized in order to reach a positive resolution is one we could actually believe existed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnjoyment<br />\r\nSo how much did I enjoy Hundred, then?  I didn&#039;t.  There was nothing to enjoy here.  Weirdly, I&#039;m not even mad, the show didn&#039;t make me feel enough to actually get worked up about it.  Forcing myself to think it through for this review I find that its problem isn&#039;t that it did anything insultingly wrong, but that it never provided anything worthwhile.  The action is lame, the plot is a failure, the characters are lifeless... there&#039;s just nothing here.  This show had no ambition and no creativity, none at all.  I feel like I should apologize to other shows I&#039;ve had harsh words for.  Clockwork Planet may have been guilty of most of the same failings as Hundred, but at least Clockwork Planet had a creative premise to squander: Hundred is happy having no premise at all: the Savage, the monsters theoretically menacing humanity, are never addressed, the villain&#039;s downfall is almost insultingly not germane to anything in the story... there is nothing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStory: 1<br />\r\nArt: 4<br />\r\nSound: 5<br />\r\nCharacter: 1<br />\r\nEnjoyment: 1<br />\r\nTotal: 2<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinal Verdict<br />\r\nDo yourself a favor and don&#039;t watch Hundred.  You&#039;ll be missing out on nothing.\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286733" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286733">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286733"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286733">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286733" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286733" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

Saga of Tanya the Evil &quot;, is the animated adaptation, in twelve episodes, of the light novel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe technical apparatus has done a remarkable job, guaranteeing the product a high quality from the first to the last episode. The animations are really high, a little gem, the detail is often well taken care of and the colors I liked very much. The chara design is not bad and in general it can be said that all the graphic apparatus has done a praiseworthy work.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe sound is well done, with opening and ending catchy and good soundtrack, not excelled, but absolutely not poor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nScript\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286732">\n        and direction I liked, in some moments it seemed to me that there were some very fast frequencies that maybe would have required some details and a bit of extra work to avoid bewildering or confusing the viewer, but in general what is done positive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the narration, the themes touched are different. The point from which everything unravels is the rejection of the protagonist, extremely rational, pragmatic and cynical character, with a critical sense and highly developed acumen, to accept the existence of God, whom he calls entity X after their meeting (concerning this I forward, I prefer to reveal as little as possible of the story). The protagonist will find himself in a similar world but different from his own, with a story similar to the story he knows, but with the necessary differences. The underlying theme of the narration is also the war, which can be seen as the battle scenario between the protagonist and the entity X. War analyzed and developed very well both tactically and strategically. Through the eyes of our protagonist we see the development of events and the evolution of situations, situations that, the more our Tanya strives to lead to a happy ending, the more they head towards the historical ending that we know (but it will really so? Quiet, there is a second season, I could not &#039;spoiler&#039; even if you want).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaving said that, as well as for the technical apparatus, why look at this series, you might ask me. Well, a talented player who climbs the military hierarchy, with decades of historical experience behind him that allows him to prevail over what he sees, intelligent, rational and cynical, which engages a crusade against a God who not only does not submit, but which he even refuses to exist. All this takes place in a vaguely historical and fantasy sauce, in which it is easy to immerse yourself and foresee possible future developments thanks to the cultural baggage that (perhaps) we share with our Tanya.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow do not tell me that all this, at least a little, does not tickle you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nListen to me, and give this anime a chance, I am sure that most of you will not be disappointed.\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286732" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286732">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286732"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286732">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286732" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286732" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

It will be that at my venerable age this kind of product impassions decidedly less than during adolescence, but I really find the series of a unique mediocrity. Indeed no, not unique, since the only &quot;BNHA&quot; has very little.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe protagonist is the usual unfortunate being who rages in all the animes of action: besides not stand out in the whole of his peers, to turn the knife in the wound is also well below the average, not having any kind of peculiarity between the paranormal and the metaphysical. Not to miss anything is also clumsy,\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286731">\n        clumsy, mistreated by the only being with which he usually accompanies himself, perhaps even a bit of a slow owl of understanding; but he has a heart of gold, eh, good, intelligent, studious and generous. He seems to hear his own parent describing us to a friend: &quot;Yes, come on, maybe he&#039;s not the best in the world, but hell, he&#039;s good and devoted&quot;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe incipit of the plot is common to all other products of the genre: the poor unfortunate being, always below average, insignificant and insipid, suddenly finds the way to highlight, to be noticed, to stand out. Magic of spells, wow, what an unexpected twist, this.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe works hard, he kills himself with fatigue, he stomps and sweats and slams and blasphemes from the effort. Originality of originality, never seen a protagonist who makes the deck, look a bit. And magic of magic, his physical and inner travail is rewarded by the celestial blessing, which allows him thanks to some subterfuge of which none other was aware of getting back on par with his peers and take possession of a famous and known special power. No more then the last of the last, the bischero that no one calculates, the patch of feet on which we all clean the muddy shoes after the storm, but a normal guy who, lucky chance, has from his work ethic and the attributes necessary to break in spite of the others, born with all the advantages and therefore do not know how to get out of trouble with their own hands.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe rest of the plot also fails to homologate too much to other products, but it must be said that much is due to the particular format of the series of anime with the superheroes is not that they have seen so many, indeed, so everything is easier and everything it is earned.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe psychology that moves the characters, and the protagonist in particular, is hurried and chopped. &quot;See, dear spectator, if you&#039;re going to beat me like me, if you work hard like me, you can make your dreams come true ... Of course, having a superhero hair in your stomach helps, I do not deny it, but it&#039;s a side appearance of being beaten up worse of a carpet with the batti-cloths If you work like me, like me you will succeed. &quot; Really: if instead of &quot;superhero hair&quot; using terms like &quot;nine-tailed fox&quot; or &quot;Gom-Gom fruit&quot; or &quot;being a Saiyan of another planet&quot; I would have described &quot;Naruto&quot;, &quot;One Piece&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; &quot;without even trying too hard to change words and words. The other characters are similarly triti: the childhood friend-bar-sworn enemy full of pride, the beautiful and sprinkled, the nerd, the frigid, the tiny specimen of stature that looks more like a stuffed animal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet&#039;s sum up. The events will also be pleasant, opening and closing will also be interesting and &quot;hot&quot;, the format on the superhero will also be new, but the juice of the matter is monotonous, already seen, not exciting. Personally I struggle to give him the sufficiency, because in the same way I struggle not to consider this his analogous and homologous being a great point of demerit. Most will love this or that element, experiencing shipping between the characters and drooling over the acronyms; I, that being a single individual I can not constitute the majority, I find all of a cloying banality\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286731" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286731">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286731"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286731">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286731" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286731" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

Each episode features a unique drink accompanied by a brief explanation of the ingredients, i.e: 200 ML milk + 1 tbsp honey + 1 tbsp orange marmalade + 1 banana slice = A delicious banana cocktail. Yum. There&#039;s even a small community of fans dedicated to replicating the recipes from this anime (with varying results of success) that can be found on youtube and various blogs. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286730">\n        care for alcohol then perhaps you&#039;d be interested in the perverted pandering of a thicc blonde getting wasted every episode in the company of her husband. Chisato is a stoic businesswoman by day and a sloppy drunk by night that makes a barrage of cute faces and puts her body in compromising positions. Unfortunately for viewers with lewd expectations, Chisato&#039;s husband Sora displays a level of self restraint that would put a nun to shame, denying every single physical advance of his extremely sexy wife while she is under the influence of alcohol. As a self professed ecchi degenerate this was very annoying.

(&quot;Kimi no Na wa&quot; in original) is one of the most popular Japanese animated films of recent years. &quot;Moving History&quot;, &quot;Beautiful&quot;, even &quot;Masterpiece&quot;! When I found myself in front of this film, intrigued by the avalanches of super-positive reviews, I thought: &quot;Damn, it must really be a real film phenomenon!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, let&#039;s start with a simple but concrete concept: when you look at an anime or manga anyway praised in any way, whether it&#039;s reviews or awards, the reactions you can have, after finally having decided to see or read it, are two: satisfaction and admission that, in fact, that anime / manga is\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286729">\n        really a good product, as everyone says, or disappointment and consecutive question &quot;I&#039;m the problem or you really shouted at the masterpiece too early?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Your Name.&quot; it&#039;s definitely a great product for animation. The details are taken care of up to the smallest, the colors are a balm for the eyes. In short, you can not say anything, except that the film is really well done - at this point, which is, for a large part, the reason why I gave enough to this review.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe soundtrack is not bad. I have seen dozens of animes have a hundred times better, but it is still appreciable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThen we move on to the two points that are probably the most important and those that make the difference in any product: the story and the characters. I am of the idea, and I think that there are many others too, that these two things outweigh all the visual and sonic aspects of an anime by far. The latter may have a mediocre design, but what will really make you appreciate it will be an engaging story and a good characterization of the characters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWarning! I do not detract at all from the animation nor the soundtrack. The latter, above all, many times is the one that makes you excite more. Not always good music is accompanied by an equally good story. Often, unfortunately, excellent OST are, so to speak, &quot;wasted&quot; in a trivial and unoriginal story.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWarning: the following paragraph contains spoilers<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut let&#039;s get back to history and characters. The plot of &quot;Your Name.&quot; it is not very addictive. The theme of the &quot;exchange of bodies&quot; has been dealt with in many films and anime, but, with all this, just after reading all those beautiful reviews, I thought that here the theme would be exploited in a different way. &quot;Your Name.&quot; it has nothing really original. It is a love story that comes suddenly, which seems to die, but which, in reality, as in any romantic film, returns to reign.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNot to mention the various oversights of the author. There are some flaws in the plot, among which I mention the one that left me perplexed to the end: how did Taki not remember a great disaster like the fall of a comet that happened only three years ago? <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnd of part containing spoilers<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe characters, Mitsuha and Taki. What I look for in a character is a good characterization. The two protagonists, however, are ... practically flat. If I had to give an adjective to everyone to describe them, I do not know what I would say. And I&#039;m sorry about this, because I believe that the characters are, very often, the pillars of an anime / manga. In an unoriginal story like that of &quot;Your Name.&quot;, Two protagonists with a strong characterization would be needed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverall, &quot;Your Name.&quot; it is not a masterpiece. Absolutely. It&#039;s a nice film, which deserves to be seen (only) especially for the graphics, which is objectively marvelous.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nToo bad, because I am of the idea that even an unoriginal storyline, if exploited well, can make a film look like an excellent product.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286729" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286729">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286729"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286729">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286729" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286729" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

is a twelve-episode anime that aired from October to December 2017.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaika is a girl with a good family, well-mannered and kind, she has only one small problem, a chilling smile that scares anyone to death. For this reason, the poor woman can not find a job with which she hopes to earn money to go to study abroad after high school.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat&#039;s when an opportunity opens up: work in a maid cafe where employees play a role. And who better than the small and polite Maika to interpret the sadistic and contemptuous maid?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe will then follow the story of the protagonist, who\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286727">\n        will interact with many different characters, in particular Dino, the manager of Italian origins, in love with Maika, who will try to conquer it in the most unlikely ways.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI will begin by saying that one of the most positive elements of this anime is the distance between the true personality of the characters and the role they play:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKaho, passionate about videogames with a cheerful and sunny personality, interprets the tsundere;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMafuyu, who plays the happy and sweet little sister, bullies Dino and is actually very serious and efficient;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMiu, writer of &quot;hot&quot; stories, seeks inspiration while interpreting the onee-san;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHideri, who plays the idol, is, well, as the opening suggests, a surprise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis particularity, which then is precisely the premise of the Anime, is not fully exploited, in my opinion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore than being a choral anime, the story focuses on Maika and Dino and, if at the beginning the gags are also funny, with the going of the episodes they lose freshness and become repetitive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHonestly I would have preferred if the story was not always focused on Maika, but also left space for the other characters, which happens very few times. A couple that I wanted to be more in-depth is that of Kaho and Akizuki, the kitchen help, whose interactions are kept fun for the whole duration of the anime, or, for example, I would like to see the typical day of Mafuyu, all &#039; university or with a possible love interest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith this I do not want to say that it is a product to be completely discarded, it is still a light series, which lets you look and that has managed to tear me more than a smile in every episode. Simply, if they took more advantage of the secondary characters or showed more dynamics between the waitresses and the clients, there would have been a wider variety of gags and would have been able to entertain more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs for the technical sector, the chara is cute but simple, and the animations is not particularly worthy of note. Special mention for the opening that for twelve episodes never often make me smile and make my head move in time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSummarizing it in a sentence or not: &quot;A simple and light Anime, with an interesting premise, which unfortunately failed to conquer me.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286727" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286727">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286727"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286727">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286727" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286727" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

Natsume contains 6 adaptations in anime, totaling 74 episodes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nmaking a short synopsis, The Takashi (Protagonist), since he was young he was able to see Youkais / Ayakashis, who are basically &quot;Monsters/Demons&quot;, and since this was too much burden for a child, he ended up having a difficult life and was half isolated of others.<br />\r\nAt one point he inherits from his grandmother the so-called &quot;Book of Friends.&quot; and then discovers that she actually shared the same ability to see youkais as\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286726">\n        him.<br />\r\nI will not go into the details about the book and his grandmother, because it&#039;s more fun to figure out how everything works by watching.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven the story spinning all the time around the youkais, natsume is also an analysis about humans. It focuses both on the bonds between humans themselves and the bonds between Youkais and Humans.<br />\r\nEvery story you see is well thought out and crafted, and it always seeks to bring a deep message and thus more developmment for the show.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNatsume is that kind of sweet show that will always try its best to make you empathize with everything in it.<br />\r\nevery bit of it brings a sad feeling. But that feeling is at once cozy you know?<br />\r\nAnd so he ends up holding you, Exploring your emotions to the fullest and making them toy all the time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpeaking of the characters, Natsume is full of unique and iconic personalities, and this is not just about humans but true for youkais as well.<br />\r\nTakashi does not help the youkais because he has nothing better to do, he helps them because the bond he has with them is strong and very well explored throughout the anime. Enough even for him by himself at risk.<br />\r\nFrom a person who has been forced to move away from almost every human, takashi grows to trust humans once more, as he shares his experiences with those around him, conquering people who become totally dear to him.<br />\r\nThe madara (Nyanko), for example, at first he only has one goal and demonstrates that he could do everything for him, but over time he clings to Takashi and despite his own contradictions, he seems to care more about his mate Takashi), than with the aim of it.<br />\r\nAnother interesting part are the youkais, usually they do not get so much focus out of their respective unique episodes, but they always manage to leave their own mark, each one becomes quite memorable, their internal conflicts, their goals and personalities are all very well thought out and makes it even hard to believe that that character was only there for only 20 minutes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nabout art and animation, Natsume is very simplistic mainly at the beginning, but this serves as a glove pro style anime, this gives you a much more complete immersion of the anime atmosphere, with beautiful designs, wonderful scenery and a beautiful color palette together with a fluid animation (and that improves with the passing of the seasons without losing the original essence).<br />\r\nNatsume has the best openings and endings I&#039;ve ever heard, and I&#039;m not just talking about the song itself but its lyrics, all instrumental composition, everything is done in detail to stay in a beautiful harmony with all elements of the anime, making you create an even greater affection throughout history.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWell is basically this, if you want to try, I assure you that it is worth mostly for those who like slice of life and sentimental things.\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286726" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286726">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286726"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286726">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286726" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286726" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

A good ending is essential for a good anime, and this one failed to deliver such an ending. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe art was constantly good throughout the whole show, 8/10 for that, didn&#039;t look great or anything like mob psycho or\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286724">\n        Serial Experiments lay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe sound was seeming less and great. A good memorable opening, good voice actors all around. It was a nice relief to hear an adult when he was thinking, rather than always hearing a child. However, both were great actors. 10/10 for sound.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe characters were very well developed, but again, ruined at the final &quot;Arc&quot;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy enjoyment was 10/10 in the beginning, but it was around a 6 for the last three episodes, so it is 8/10.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverall, I rate it an 8/10, and yes, the manga did do the ending differently, however, it did it badly too.

Assassin\xe2\x80\x99s Creed is the worst example of this. For a series that I use to love has now turned a milking cow for Ubisoft where after\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286717">\n        the release Assassin\xe2\x80\x99s Creed Revelations Ubisoft has been desperately been milking the franchise by making poorly done squeals such as Assassin\xe2\x80\x99s Creed Unity to unnecessary spinoffs such as Assassin\xe2\x80\x99s Creed Chronicles which was a side-scrolling/Puzzle/Stealth game that not only bored me to tears but it perfectly represents how the Assassin\xe2\x80\x99s Creed series has fallen just by being milked to death.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe same cash grabbing bullshit can apply for anime and the biggest offender for this is easily the Naruto franchise. Not only they have made countless pointless Naruto movies but the creators for that show constantly tried it\xe2\x80\x99s hardest to keep it alive by having a crap tone of filler episodes to having an awful squeal series Burto the next generation which was the creators attempt to keep the Naruto series alive even though it\xe2\x80\x99s getting One For All smashed by My Hero Academia constantly. How does this cash grab bullshit relate to Neon Genesis Evangelion Death and Rebirth?  Well to put this straightforward Neon Genesis Evangelion Death and Rebirth is one of the most shameless cash-grabs to ever come out from this medium. Unlike the other two series that I just mention where I slightly give them points for trying to make they series reverent in the modern era for they respective mediums this movie has no reason to exist whatsoever and it should be burned to the ground.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first 67 minutes of this movie being the death part is a lazily done recap off all the events of the first 24 episodes off the show including the director\xe2\x80\x99s cut stuff that was released later by ADV Films? Not only does this part of the movie does an aboustly horrendous job at telling all the important events off the series but it somehow manages to completely butcher certain iconic scenes from the series by adding in shitty visual directing as well having a laughable script that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t present in the original series at all.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore we talk about my favorite part of this movie let\xe2\x80\x99s quickly talk about the rebirth part of the movie. Despite being the first 30 minutes of End Of Evangelion where it actually has new scenes that never existed in the TV series it\xe2\x80\x99s still a pointless teaser for End Of Evangelion movie where once again it only exists just to lazily draw people in. I won\xe2\x80\x99t be talking about the Rebirth part of the movie because I will be talking about it in my End of Evangelion review.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow with that said let\xe2\x80\x99s get to my favorite part of this movie the 4 minutes and 24-second intermission. No joke. That intermission countdown along was the best thing to come out from this movie because not only it features relaxing and chilling music but the almost fully black screen fully symbolize that the series from this point onwards is going to hell. This is easily the best part about this pointless movie.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs for the visuals minus the intermission screen and the rebirth apart of the film, the visuals were shit overall thanks to the creators lazily reusing footage of the series but somehow making the visual and audio quality worse than the TV series.<br />\r\nMusic is still great as ever but that\xe2\x80\x99s should be expected at this point. The same thing can apply for the voice acting not counting that horrendous English Dub for it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverall minus the amazing intermission countdown screen, this movie is absolutely pointless. The Death part of the movie was horrendously directed to the aboustly core, the rebirth part of the movie despite being a 30-minute teaser of End Of Evangelion is a shitty attempt at drawing the audience in and the visuals quality in the movie is shit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf your planning to check out the Evangelion series go watch the TV series instead. This movie is not worth your time at all.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinal Score 2/10\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286717" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286717">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286717"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286717">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286717" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286717" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

Meanwhile, Seele puts the Human Instrumentality Project plan into monition as now Nerv must now defend themselves from Seele and prevent the third impact from happening.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAct I: The creation and the main purpose of the film.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore we talk about what I thought about the story and characters of End of Evangelion let\xe2\x80\x99s go over the background\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286716">\n        of The End Of Evangelion as well the creator himself Hideaki Anno. Hideaki Anno created anime such as Gunbuster, Nadia The Secret Of Blue Water, Neon Genesis Evangelion, His and Her Circumstances, and Gunbuster.<br />\r\nHonestly, I really liked and enjoyed his works especially Neon Genesis Evangelion where I consider to be his best work. Now at the time when Neon Genesis Evangelion was airing like with Tomino for Mobile Suit Victory Gundam, he was suffering through depression and just like with Tomino Mobile Suit Victory Gundam the depression really hit by the second half of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Because of that the second half Neon Genesis Evangelion became a psychological drama instead of being of a monster of the week type of show. Then comes the final 2 episodes of the show and like with many people on the net we thought the ending of the TV series was total shit. It had gotten to the point where people inducing fans of the show were sending letters to Anno which some of them were actual death threats. Ultimately Anno decided to re-create the final 2 episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion in the form of the movie called Neon Genesis Evangelion The End Of Evangelion where it not only was meant to close off many of the plot threads in the series but it also meant to give the series a proper ending that it deserves.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAct II: The grotesque but beautifully written first half.<br />\r\nNeon Genesis Evangelion The End Of Evangelion is by far one of the darkest pieces of media I have ever seen.<br />\r\nRight out the bat, the movie wastes no time showcasing it\xe2\x80\x99s darker tone where the first couple of scenes we are presented with disgusting acts done by Shinji where not only he tried to commit suicide by drowning he jerks off to a comatose Asuka after failing to wake her up. I really liked the first scenes a lot because not only they are extremely well directed but does a masterful job of portraying the themes and topics of suicide, depression and downfall spiral. Not to mention as soon as Shinji finished jerking off of comatose Asuka he is filled with disgust he quickly says the following lines \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so fucked up\xe2\x80\x9d. The jerking off scene may not be for everyone due it\xe2\x80\x99s disgusting nature but what it was it\xe2\x80\x99s a well executed as it perfectly foreshadows the tone of the movie.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow with that beautifully grotesque hospital scene done with let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about the first half of End Of Evangelion.<br />\r\nThe first half of The End Of Evangelion minus the hospital scene goes back to the first half of the TV roots where it\xe2\x80\x99s all action pack that its filled with explosions and fights. However, unlike the first half of the TV series, the first half of the movie has a much darker thanks to it kill them all nature whereby the end of the first half almost every character in Nerv is dead including one of the mains characters which I will talk about soon.<br />\r\nAsuka battle with the Mass Unit Evas is by far my favorite scene of the movie. Not only it\xe2\x80\x99s beautifully written and directed to the absolute core but it perfectly concludes her character arc even if her conclusion wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly a happy one.<br />\r\nThe final thing I want to talk about in this part of the movie was Misato death. Personally, Misato was my favorite character in the series because the not only beautifully written character that we can all relate to thanks to her backstory but she\xe2\x80\x99s was a fun and likable character. We don\xe2\x80\x99t see Misato much in the movie mainly because he only appears in a couple of scenes but when she show\xe2\x80\x99s up in the movie she is still awesome as ever as she concludes her character with an emotional bang that honestly made me cry.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAct III: The fantastic psychological second half and the origin of Rei.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore I talk about the psychological elements in the movie I want to talk about is Rei\xe2\x80\x99s origin as well her role in the movie. In my review of Neon Genesis Evangelion I quickly talked about Rei but now I think it\xe2\x80\x99s best to talk about her origin and purpose in the series and the movie. Rei was created by Gendo Ikari and Kozo Fuyutsuki attempt to retrieve Shinji\xe2\x80\x99s mother Yui Ikari. The attempt failed on some level where Rei may incorporate DNA from the Second Angel, Lilith because she is the vessel for Lilith\xe2\x80\x99s soul. Now there are three Rei\xe2\x80\x99s in the series.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRei I was created around sometime in 2004-2008 where she is shown as a small child wearing a red dress in episode 21. After that Rei 1 gets murdered by Naoko Akagi, for revealing that Gendo Ikari referred to her as an \xe2\x80\x98old hag\xe2\x80\x99 behind her back.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRei II is the second incarnation of Rei aka the Rei that we have been following in the series. Rei II is shown to be a teenager who is age 14 the same as Shinji. Rei II has a stronger relationship with Gendo meaning she does whatever he says without question. Not only that but he she as a building relationship with Shinji. She sacrifices herself by setting her AT Field to maximum to draw Armisael to herself and try to contain it temporarily and then activated Eva-00\xe2\x80\x99s self-destruct to kill both of them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRight after Rei II death, Rei III was created however she has no memories of saving Shinji as she states that \xe2\x80\x9cI think am the third\xe2\x80\x9d<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow does this relate to Rei\xe2\x80\x99s role in the second half of the movie to put this straightforward Rei is the most important character in the movie even more than Asuka, Misato and at times Shinji. She is a character that is impossible to relate too but I think that the whole point of Rei as a character. She\xe2\x80\x99s not human at all but rather an angel in human form. Her whole existence in the series is meant to serve where the reason why Rei was created is so that Gendo can have a controllable link with Lilith for the Human Instrumentality Project where in the movie he tries to use Rei to allow to see Yui again. However, Rei rejects Gendo by taking his arm so she can regenerate her lost arm as well using merging with Lilith to start the third impact. Just from these are moments alone Rei has become my second favorite in the movie because not only she was a fascinating character that I loved but it all comes together in the end especially in the third impact part of the movie where she concludes her character arc. Not to mention seeing all three Rei together was amazing and it made me tear up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow with Rei done let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about the psychological elements of the movie.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the first half of the movie is action-packed with a darker tone the second half of the movie mainly focus on The Third Impact as well as all the psychological elements that the series is known for. The psychological elements are nothing but amazing. Not only it well directed that is filled with great symbolism that highlight the series core themes but all of the psychological elements and themes come to a beautiful conclusion for Shinji character as a whole.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t be talking about the Third Impact as well the last scene because that should be experienced for yourselves but all I can about it that it\xe2\x80\x99s downright amazing and beautiful.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverall the story and characters of The End Of Evangelion is perfection to the eye. It may be confusing but if you go back and re-watch the series and the movie a couple of times everything from story, characters, themes, and symbolism will come together.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAct IV Final: The wonderful visual and music upgrade.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVisually this movie is fantastic. It took everything that we liked the series visual wise and expanded it to new heights. Production I.G and Gainax really did a wonderful job with its visuals as not only it is very well animated but the visuals direction and editing was just masterful. This is by far one of the best-animated anime movies I have ever seen period.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe same thing can be said for the soundtrack is which is a big upgrade from the series as every single track in the moves manages to fit the tone of the movie perfectly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow for sub vs dub Not gonna lie the dub for The End Of Evangelion has improved quite a bit when compared to the TV series but at the same time the dub still had a lot of problems. At the end of the day if you want to best experience of this series I strongly recommend the sub because not only it\xe2\x80\x99s well acted but it does a much better justice on key scenes of the movie. Am not trying to say that the dub was awful or anything as it was improved quite a bit from the series but at the end of the day the dub of Evangelion is very inferior to its sub counterpart.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEpilogue.<br />\r\nNeon Genesis Evangelion The End Of Evangelion is a fantastic film. It took everything that was great from the series and expanded it to new heights. It concludes all the story and theme elements in the show. it concludes all the beautifully written character arcs that the series has built up from the very beginning. It masterfully concludes Neon Genesis Evangelion as a whole. There is nothing like The End Of Evangelion and all the anime that tried to copy it afterward (cough Darling in the Franxx and Puella Magi Madoka Magica the Movie: Rebellion) fail thanks to horrendous overall execution.<br />\r\nneon-genesis-evangelion-zero-two-darling-in-the-franxx-crossover-anime-22117-resized.jpg<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the series yet then I strongly recommend you checking out the series first before watching this film.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe End Of Evangelion is a masterful film that I will forever love.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinal Score 10/10\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286716" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286716">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286716"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286716">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286716" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286716" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

They are doing nothing but reusing older ideas, instead of having new ones. And on top of that, they don\xe2\x80\x99t even do a good job at rehashing the same ideas. They are not trying to improve or refine them. They just make them more creepy, sexual, and edgy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey also ride on the name of who made them, instead of how good they are on their own, and do their best to keep you interested with how absurd they are\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286715">\n        by constantly making up memes and crazy situations, without actually caring about the quality of the script or good characterization.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe show does its best to make hate everything from the very beginning. You get the scene where they establish the main character, and all you get is a bland self-insert who recited emo poetry and there is an injured bird that symbolizes something. First impressions are crucial for getting to like a character, and instead of giving you an interesting personality, or a cool design, or a sad backdrop, they throw in stolen quotes and symbolism, which have nothing to do with him as a person you are supposed to like for being a person.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is all nothing but pretentious overthinking replacing characterization. How can you still care after that? Same thing with the main female character. The establishing scene is about her being naked and crazy. What is there to care about her after that, besides the doujin you will look for when you want to masturbate?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe funny part is that the majority of modern anime fans are fine with this trash, because they gave up on expecting to watch something good. Most of the community was calling this abomination the best title of the year, just so they can be part of the seasonal hype, write essays about symbolism, make theories about what might happen, only to lose interest as soon as it\xe2\x80\x99s over, so they can move to the next trash that is about to come out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut until that happens, they will be kept preoccupied with two seasons of boring one-dimensional characters, each one defined by type rather than an interesting personality, as they spend their time trying to understand sex. Just by this set-up, you know this is bad from the get-go, since everything is defined by numbers and percentages instead of, you know, personalities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe characters have nothing to do outside of piloting waifubots by doing doggy style sex. This gets old very fast, since you don\xe2\x80\x99t give a shit about action scenes that involve awful mecha designs and sex metaphors. Plus, the characters have no backdrop story since they haven\xe2\x80\x99t done anything interesting in their whole lives. Their social interaction is limited to talking to equally flat people like themselves. Also, there are so many of them it becomes a snorefest to tolerate an episode dedicated to each of them; especially when you know only the main two characters matter in the story. Most others don\xe2\x80\x99t contribute to the plot in any way; they are just there to waste episodes on sexual innuendos.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt could have been a decent watch if it stayed that way and didn\xe2\x80\x99t try to have a plot or deeper meanings, but it did and it backfired horribly. For most of the episodes, there were no explanations for why they are fighting monsters or why the world looks like a huge desert. The writers were constantly teasing an answer to all that, and to the most part did nothing to prepare the audience for it, since most of the episodes were wasted on the sexual frustrations of inept waifubot pilots. All the emphasis was placed on vapid love triangles, cheating, cuckholding, and shameless references to older mecha. That became the only thing the audience of this abomination was caring for.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvidence for how little thought was placed into the making of a cast, can be found when observing what happens to them once they manage to resolve the conflict they were written with during their inception. The single trait that was defining them ceases to exist, and they become black pieces of paper, since whatever specs of personality they had was defined by their conflict. Essentially, the moment their emotional baggage is lifted, they stop having a personality.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEventually the explanations for the mystery arrived in a rushed and retarded way, completely changing the atmosphere of the show, and as if by magic made everybody to realize the show was crap all along, despite that being obvious from the very beginning. After that, everybody was calling it a trainwreck and left them wondering how did Trigger, the savior of anime, ruined the potentially best anime of the year (lol).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome tried to defend this horseshit by saying previous Trigger and Gainax series were also becoming bizarre as time went on, and that it\xe2\x80\x99s unfair to hate Darling when it was constantly reusing ideas from them. Those defenders are of course idiots who don\xe2\x80\x99t see how said older anime had far fewer characters, with far more personality and backdrop stories, and had much smoother transitions by not wasting as many episodes on worthless characters, thus being left with enough duration to work things through a lot better.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut hey, this is a modern anime, so who gives a shit about any of that? The point is to forget it the moment is over and move to the next trainwreck. \n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286715" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286715">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286715"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286715">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286715" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286715" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

It was not only one of the two anime that introduced me to the romcom genre back in 2012 the other one being Clannad but it was the first romcom anime that I ever loved. I loved it so much that when I eventually started to buy animes DVDs back in 2015 Toradora was the third anime I brought. From that point on I re-watched Toradora least 2 to 3 times per year and I still\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286714">\n        love it even if it had some flaws that I started to notice on my last re-watch of it. Now unlike Clannad where my opinion of that show worst as years went on to a point I haven\xe2\x80\x99t touched my Season 1 and After Story DVD sets for almost a year thanks to me having low value of the series due to heavy flaws Toradora my opinion on Toradora has stayed positive to this day despite its minor flaws I still think Toradora is the best modern romcom anime to ever come out.<br />\r\nSo what made Toradora so special.<br />\r\nWhy do I still love this show to this day?<br />\r\nWell let&#039;s find out shall we.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStory and Characters.<br />\r\nThe story follows Ryuji Takasu who is getting ready for his second year at high school. Despite being an overall nice guy he has a mistaking reputation for looking like a delinquent thanks to he evil looking eyes as well as his facial structure looking like a young yakuza member rather than a high school student. His best friend Yuusaku as well his crush Minori (whom he is too bashful to approach) are the only two people who actually don\xe2\x80\x99t mind his evil looking eye appearance. Soon by complete accident, he bumps into a main female lead and tsundere Taiga Aisaka aka the Palmtop Tiger.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter an accidental first encounter that ends with Taiga KO-ing him in the face, Ryuuji finds out at the end of the school day that Taiga has put a love letter to Kitamura (whom she has a crush on but is too bashful to approach) in his bag by accident. This leads to Taiga breaking into his house that night to retrieve the letter by killing him with a bamboo sword only to discover that she forgot to put the letter in the envelope and has inadvertently outed her crush on Kitamura to Ryuuji.<br />\r\nAfter much ado and a few sword-blows, Ryuuji and Taiga strike a tenuous deal to use their positions as The Best Friends to help each other bag their respective crushes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow the story of Toradora may be very simple in nature but the execution is downright amazing.<br />\r\nRight out the bat, the show makes a great first impression as the first episode does a wonderful job at establishing the setting, tone, characters, and themes of the show. The show also knows what it wants as it says true to its roots as a slice of life, drama romcom series without being something that is not.<br />\r\nThe show does a brilliant job of exploring the themes and topics of running away, true love, being your true self, breaking your shell and it does them all great.<br />\r\nThe show also does a great job at keeping the audience with all the story events that happen in the show by having great writing and for the most part great overall pacing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe characters in Toradora are all fantastic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRyuji is a great male lead. He may appear as this generic delinquent who hates everyone with that Yakusa look but he\xe2\x80\x99s actually a nice and friendly guy who care for others. He also an obsessive neat freak where he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like messy houses and he would go out of his way to clean everything that he can. The best example of this was when Ryuji enters Taiga house for the first time. Despite Ryuiji having great personality traits he\xe2\x80\x99s is a well-developed character who has great character chemistry with the cast especially Taiga.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTaiga despite being the queen of tsundere is actually a pretty great character. From start to finish I liked her character development as her interactions towards the rest of the cast. She may appear as this Lousie and Shana but unlike Lousie and at times Shana where they are tsundere for the sake for it Taiga\xe2\x80\x99s tsundere behavior rarely mirror her true feelings.<br />\r\nShe may not be for everyone but if you can pass her tsundere side you will start to see how humanly flawed Taiga is as a person.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf I had to pick my favorite character in Toradora it would be Minori. She is a sweet and upbeat person who loves to keep everybody happy but there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot than that. In order for her to cope with own internal struggles and loneliness, she plays softball as well as working on a series of part-time jobs. Her character development in the series was great and I really loved every scene that she\xe2\x80\x99s was in. Overall brilliant character.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow we have Kitamura Taiga crush and Ryuji best friend. Not gonna lie I thought I Kitamaru was pretty bland in the beginning as he just came as this typical smart guy chararters. Thankfully he does become a much better character as the series as he had a great character arc that was well told and it had a satisfying conclusion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, we have Ami who is a childhood friend of Kitamura. Before transferring schools, she was a fashion designer. <br />\r\nShe may start off as this typical fan-service character but there is much more to her. In school, she plays a facade where she behaves as this cute and ditzy girl but she\xe2\x80\x99s actually a mean and spoiled bitch. I honestly really loved this character. She\xe2\x80\x99s probably my second favorite character in the show only losing to Minori. She is just is a joy to watch every-time she was on screen especially in the end of her character arc where she confronts the guy who takes pictures of her by smashing his camera while giving that devious look to him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe side characters are good for what they were but apart from Yuri and Sumire the side characters are not as memorable as the mains.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI could go on and on of how great this anime is sadly I have to talk about the show\xe2\x80\x99s flaws because there are only two of them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor starters, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the portrayal of Ryuji mom where she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really behave an adult figure where instead of being a prideful or strick mother she often behaves like a kid who lazy and constantly have parties while the child always picks up all the things for them. Am not saying that Adults cannot have any fun whatsoever because I believe that all adults should have fun when are not working but Ryuji mother doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like a responsible mother at all. As much I liked how Ryuji mother aspects Taiga as a family member she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really set any rules or do anything that a mother should do.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe second and final minor flaw is its predictable nature. Personally, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind if a show is predictable in nature because as long if it\xe2\x80\x99s written well it I can completely ignore its predictable nature and thankfully Toradora, for the most part, is a great ride that I enjoyed even it\xe2\x80\x99s predictable. However if you a person who is not a fan of predictable stories than this show will most likely won\xe2\x80\x99t like this show especially when certain scenes in Toradora actually highlight the end of the show before you even get there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther than the two minor flaws which I just mentioned the story and characters in Toradora was amazing.<br />\r\n9/10<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVisuals.<br />\r\nThe background scenery is very appealing to look at. The charterers for both the main and supporting are great looking.<br />\r\nAs for the actual animation itself, I thought it was very good and well handled. Sure the beginning the animation is basic stuff but when we get to the actual action and emotional scenes of the series the animation really shines. The best examples of this were Taiga vs Sumire fight in episode 16 to Taiga emotional breakdown in episode 19.<br />\r\nOverall the visuals of Toradora were very nice and appealing to the eye.<br />\r\n8.5/10<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSound.<br />\r\nThe soundtrack for Toradora is pretty great overall. I know not many people were a not fan of the soundtrack and I can understand they are coming from but I thought the soundtrack for Toradora was well made as it perfectly captures the tone and setting of Toradora perfectly. One of the song track Lost my Pieces from Toradora is not only my favorite track from Toradora but it\xe2\x80\x99s also my second favorite track piece from a romance only losing to Always be With You from Kodocha.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome of my other favorite tracks include Startup, Magic of Love, Morning Glory, Happy Monday and Ready Steady Go. They are just brilliant tracks overall.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll the opening and endings themes in Toradora are great in their own ways and they are extremely catchy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow for sub vs dub.<br />\r\nI only saw the sub twice back in 2012 but I remember it being great filled with talented Seiyuus. However, as soon as I put in DVD disc one for Toradora as well watching the first couple of episodes dubbed I immediately decided to never touch the sub again. Don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong the sub is great but the dub was a special case of awesomeness. Out of all the romcom anime that I have seen Toradora has the best English dub that I have seen from a romcom anime. I was blown away by how awesome the dub was as every single voice actor and I mean every single one did a fantastic job voicing they respective characters. The one thing that the Toradora dub had over the sub is the how realistic the acting was. Just a well-made and directed dub overall.<br />\r\n10/10<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinal Thoughts.<br />\r\nToradora is a perfect example of a modern romcom anime done right. The story is well written, theme exploration is masterful, the characters are wonderful in they own ways, the visuals were nice, the soundtrack was great and the English dub was perfect.<br />\r\nToradora is not only the best modern romcom anime to ever come out it\xe2\x80\x99s but it\xe2\x80\x99s also my third favorite romcom anime period. The show may not be for everyone but for those who adored the series such we can get past its predictable nature and flaws we see a show that is beautiful and heartwarming.<br />\r\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a great romcom anime that has great characters and amazing themes exploration then I recommend Toradora.<br />\r\nIt is a wonderful anime that I will forever love.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinal Score 9.5/10\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286714" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286714">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286714"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286714">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286714" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286714" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

The adaptive manner in which this cell malignancy is combated, essentially creating chemical antigens on the spot as the chemical and molecular composition of malignant matter develops continuously, as well as the theoretical concepts behind the creation of artificial intelligence, effectively ground and invest the viewer\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286713">\n        into the very intriguing reality created by this anime on a scientific level. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n      Ultimately, what made this show interesting was not necessarily the element of looming death and viewer investment in the survival of the characters along their life-threatening journey.  Because in honesty, if something is life-threatening in a show, you&#039;re going to expect people to die.  It&#039;s not surprising. What made the show interesting, were revelations towards the science of &quot;Artificial Intelligent Organisms&quot; that bring about plot, as well as character development, leading in twists and turns that successfully surprised and countered my well-formed convictions towards the controversial solution to &quot;The Burst.&quot;  This is what engaged me as a viewer and had me binge-watching the show.  \n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286713" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286713">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286713"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286713">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286713" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286713" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

The Goblet of Fire chooses seven contenders to fight and scheme until only one is left standing. All of the players of this game have a wish that only the Goblet of Fire can grant. With the help of familiars\xe2\x80\x94spirits of warriors from ancient times\xe2\x80\x94, the contestants employ their magic and their alliances to reach the ultimate goal. I wanted to summarize up until this point and provide some background because my main criticism is about one of the familiars. The woman called \xe2\x80\x9cSaber\xe2\x80\x9d is a warrior from medieval times\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286712">\n        who wields the legendary sword Excalibur. A bit of time after she is summoned, she reveals her true name to be Arthur Pendragon. Yes, she is supposed to be King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s spirit. Although it\xe2\x80\x99s a spoiler, I can\xe2\x80\x99t ignore this obscenity for my review. Nitpicking historically inaccurate details isn\xe2\x80\x99t one of my hobbies, but since this issue is so prevalent in Fate/Zero, I won\xe2\x80\x99t hold back. Seriously, what the frick were they thinking? King Arthur is not a GIRL, okay? It says \xe2\x80\x9cking\xe2\x80\x9d in the name, idiots. Oh sure, a woman was the only one strong enough to pull a sword out of a rock. That has to be the stupidest version of the story I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard. Forget about feminist propaganda, that is a straight up attack against men and an insult to the legacy of King Arthur. Instead of honoring his name and creating a strong male character for his spirit, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just draw up a cute girl with a sword that is too heavy for her tiny feminine arms? I understand that anime panders heavily to whichever demographic is most profitable, but the quality of the show doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to suffer from it. How can I enjoy the amazing fight scenes in Fate-Zero if half of them include a character that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even exist? The answer: I can\xe2\x80\x99t because it\xe2\x80\x99s too distracting. For this reason alone I will not be watching season 2, because something tells me that our pure maiden Arthur Pendragon will make it to the end. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n2/10 for undermining the glorious masculinity of historical figures, but overall 7/10 for allowing me to jerk off to my favorite knight of the round table.\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286712" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286712">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286712"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286712">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286712" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286712" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right; text-align: right;">\n      <div title="11:54 AM">Aug 17, 2018</div>\n      <div class="lightLink spaceit">\n                  1 of ?

It Was Worth The Wait. Vento Aureo Is One Of My Favorite Jojo Arcs Because Of Its Interesting Cast and Great Storyline. The Anime Seems To Be No Different, Any Anime Fan In October Should Check Out Vento Aureo and The Rest Of The Series Of Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStory-The Story is About The Italian Maifa and The Stand Users In It.

And Jojo For EDs Use Famous Western Songs (Such As Roundabout-Yes, Walk Like A Egyptian-The Bangles and I Want You-Savage Garden.) 10/10<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCharacters-I Loved Them All and They All Had Some Solid Backstories and Character Development. My Favorites Are Mista, Fugo and Abbachio. 10/10<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnjoyment-Jojo Never Fails To Entertain, Especially In Vento Aureo.

Then muhyo tries to figure out what kind of crime the spirit did and uses some kind of magical spell book to send them to hell/purgatory/heaven.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere&#039;s not a whole lot to say . The story is kinda interesting. It&#039;s progressing slowly but since there are 12 episodes im sure it will fasten up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe 2 main characters are kinda meh. Muhyo is the one that deals with all of the spirits and Roji is the\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286709">\n        apprentice. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven thouth Roji is the apprentice when he litterelly just talks and Muhyo does all the work. But im sure they will build up Roji a bit more so he doesen&#039;t feel like thrash all the time from doing nothing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMuhyo is nothing special, the story is focused on him. Just like any other anime. The story seems interesting enought to make it work thouth so i see no problem<br />\r\n <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaybe it will get better. I think the manga would be a way better version of this then the anime since it has alot more chapters that could built up the characters more. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a kind of early review.

SPOILER WARNING &lt;&lt;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMade in Abyss was an interesting ride. Despite liking the story, I couldn&#039;t fully enjoy this show for two reasons: <br />\r\n<br />\r\n1) The first 6 episodes were so slow. I understand, they maybe want to build the world and the characters before starting an adventure but the long dialogues in these episodes felt mostly inconsequential. Not to mention we didn&#039;t really see many of the characters developed here in the later episodes. Now in a long series, this may not be a large issue but Made in Abyss consists of only 13 episodes so that&#039;s half the series right there. Now granted, a\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286708">\n        second season seems to be on the way so this is subject to change. Anyway, I enjoyed the following 7 episodes a lot more, though there are multiple reasons for that other than pace.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2) Riko. Now before you all despise me let me say I don&#039;t hate Riko completely. I actually like her enthusiasm, bravery and clumsiness... I like a lot of her traits but why did they make her a fan service character? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the first episode I thought her punishment scene was just a way to show us how the orphanage is a dark place and Riko is just so used to this behavior that they are portraying it as a normal thing. Turns out I was wrong, the *strung naked* thing was just a popular discipline technique? Okay I guess. Not an episode passes and Riko starts talking about Regu&#039;s genitals? Alright, I mean she does live in a TORTURE CHAMBER so I guess she has a weird side.. whatever.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUm... now she is just leaving the shower naked for no reason. Oh now Regu is looking at her boobs. Skinny dipping, more genital jokes, great. No matter how you look at it, you can&#039;t deny that this rather dark show chose to use its 12-year old main character for fan service. This becomes especially apparent when Riko is unconscious during episodes 10-12. Honestly I thought these episodes were the strongest of the series because she was missing. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMoving on from the negatives, the show has some strong side characters and a very good 2nd main character. Regu the &quot;Robot&quot; is more human than anyone in the show starting from Episode 1. He&#039;s curious, passionate, dependable, sometimes clueless, sometimes flawed, sometimes a pushover. I just love him, easily the best character on MiA. Then comes two side characters who saved the series starting from episode 7: Ouzen and Nanachi. I won&#039;t go into detail, but I found them both interesting and the story did a nice job developing them. I&#039;m hoping to see more of them in the 2nd season.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI can&#039;t say anything about the art that hasn&#039;t been said before, everything is just gorgeous. Visually it&#039;s the most impressive anime I&#039;ve ever seen. The soundtrack however didn&#039;t do it for me. Especially some of the solo piano songs. These background tracks shouldn&#039;t dominate the scene and distract me from what&#039;s going on, yet it happened quite a few times. But this might just be a me-thing. My favorite song by far was the opening credits song from Episode 1.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverall, I would have given MiA a 7 if I wasn&#039;t so bothered by the fan service and maybe even a 9 if some episodes weren&#039;t dragged out. Decent, and I&#039;m curious to see how Season 2 will play out.\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286708" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286708">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286708"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286708">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286708" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286708" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

They seemed too superficial and incomplete. For each of them was spent a few minutes that in my opinion was not enough to be able to fully exhaust a particular theme.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe humor was often too ridiculous because of the hysterical characters, who then often screamed like crazy and that annoyed me a lot. At a certain point the &quot;humorous&quot; scenes became even repetitive (eg, how many times were there scenes in which the various characters were disgusted by the insects, consequently\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286707">\n        losing their heads, starting to scream and move their arms and legs without a specific purpose).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmong a variety of characters in the anime, only the protagonist in a sense matures, but only with regard to his approach to calligraphy. For one who is twenty-three years old, she is definitely too childish, so much so that she spent much of her time with people much smaller than her age. I understand that a person can play with them a couple of times, just to laugh a bit, but at a certain point it&#039;s enough. &quot;Who goes with the lame, learn to limp&quot; ...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI enjoyed the atmosphere of the village, the friendly people who create an atmosphere that makes you feel at home and the presentation of what calligraphy is for the Japanese, but nothing more.<br />\r\n\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286707" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286707">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286707"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286707">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286707" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286707" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

The first thing is to praise this anime on how brilliant it is at storytelling and suspense. Even more so than the first season, this season hit those points perfectly. I said this in my previous review, but Kuroko no Basket wasn&#039;t remarkable to me initially. It doesn&#039;t deserve anything less than 10 points, but it also isn&#039;t astounding. However, this season may have changed my views on that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs I mentioned, the building of suspense is one of the few things this anime truly shines with, and it&#039;s\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286705">\n        something that I appreciate. It&#039;s very good at skewing your expectations. For example, during most of the games that Serin plays, there is an immaculate push and pull that is seen. In other words, each game begins by making the audience feel like Serin will have a fighting chance. Throughout the rest of the game, that chance will be broken and will reemerge again and again, and by the end of it, you will have no idea who will win or who will lose. Neither option will be surprising, but because the suspense is built up so well, you will feel just as dejected or just as joyful as the characters do when they lose or win respectively. This push and pull technique is used often in storytelling, but I personally don&#039;t see it used as convincingly as it&#039;s used in Kuroko no Basket. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother thing this anime is exceptional at is character work and development. Each time a character, namely Kuroko and Kagami, decides to get stronger, there will be a clear motive as to why they do so. Besides that fact, it isn&#039;t an unrealistic development. This anime doesn&#039;t raise it&#039;s characters up to a point so high that they can defy all logic previously set by the storyline. Bleach, for example, is an anime that harbored some unrealistic development of it&#039;s main character, Ichigo. It was entertaining, but knowing that someone is going to win no matter what can get boring very quickly. In Kuroko no Basket, the character&#039;s development doesn&#039;t always mean assured victory, and that&#039;s refreshing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe one negative I have about this season (and it&#039;s sort of cosmetic) is the fact that the new moves that the characters develop will have names to them. For example, Kuroko&#039;s Ignite Pass. They sound cool initially, but it isn&#039;t realistic. Even if the only ones who&#039;ve heard the move&#039;s name is Serin&#039;s Coach and Kuroko, during a game, everyone will comment on it using the name. It is a little irksome, but as I said, it&#039;s just a cosmetic issue. I understand that it&#039;s used for effect and not for realism, and it doesn&#039;t change my enjoyment of the anime at all.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHopefully this review helped some of you decide if this season or this anime is worth watching. To me, it&#039;s top quality at every moment. I suggest you give it a go.  \n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286705" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286705">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286705"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286705">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286705" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286705" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

and pretty much all Western influence on Japan. This becomes overwhelmingly evident when the Colonel meets with the council to discuss various issues. We see old feckless politicians squabbling over their social-security, medicare, the incessant whining about money and comforts. There&#039;s the collapse of order, hedonism, rot, all which is &quot;Western&quot; i.e. America. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOtomo is very sympathetic towards the Colonel, who basically encapsulates Old or pre-1945 Japan, to the point where I wondered if the Colonel wasn&#039;t the protagonist. So I&#039;d say\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286704">\n        Otomo is a &quot;conservative.&quot; <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat about &quot;Akira&quot; and Tetsuo and the Espers, and Kaneda? I take all of this to be mere plot devices to convey Otomo&#039;s opinion about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki i.e. the West and thus the future of Japan. &quot;Akira&quot; and the power associated with him/it caused these bombings. There&#039;s also a bunch of science behind the creation of Akiras. I&#039;m assuming that &quot;Akira&quot; is what the Japanese call not really Western technology, though that is part of it, but specifically the Western &quot;will to power&quot; that drives the innovation of said technology. Akira the kid, the Espers, and finally Kaneda shows what can happen when &quot;Akira&quot; is introduced to Japan. We have Tetsuo who is destroyed by the seduction of Akira, the Espers who try or are forced to moderate it, and are retarded and mutated by Akira pitifully, and Kaneda who negates it. All three will happen at once, there is no choice, and this conflict will erase Neo-Tokyo, which for Otomo is a good thing. I couldn&#039;t tell what Otomo meant beyond that since I haven&#039;t read the manga yet, but it&#039;s notable that the Colonel and Kaneda are the only ones left standing. It&#039;s clear that you have to read the manga to fully understand Otomo&#039;s story. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe animation is of the highest quality, which makes sense as this film was very expensive for its time. Really all the production is of elite quality. \n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286704" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286704">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286704"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286704">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286704" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286704" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

I will not dwell on the plot, but on what this film teaches.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe are facing a work full of messages to be transmitted, which through drawings, dialogues and even silences, makes us understand the true value that each of us should give to human relationships, to the genuineness of being and to sacrifice. And &#039;the protagonist of the story, the little\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286703">\n        Ren, who leaves us disarmed for his courage and his strength of mind, always shown to be assertive and aware of what he would have expected, including leaving his home , your own world. Doing what is right is not always the simplest choice, and sometimes you prefer to take &quot;the easy way&quot;, not to be in the midst of complications; this little boy, on the other hand, never thinks that there is a &quot;loophole&quot;: life is hard, but it must be faced by always gathering all its strength, giving its best, and knowing in your heart never to be alone, because the fraternal relationships that you he has managed to establish with someone they have no time, they have no place, they have no race and they have no convenience. Not even the latter are always simple, but, however controversial, does not mean that they can not be beautiful. Everyone has a &quot;sword in the heart&quot; to which they can cling and can be unsheathed at the right time, we just have to be aware of it. Despite the continuous fight, the constant quarrel between the boy and the beast, and despite the removal with the parent, the protagonists of this story humbly understand that we always have all to learn to understand each other, and meet each other , difficult as it may be, can only teach oneself to love each other beyond difficulties.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI hope with these words of mine to have inspired the future viewers of the film. Recommended for anyone, regardless of age.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286703" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286703">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286703"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286703">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286703" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286703" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

If you&#039;re not rooting for Nagisa and Tomoya to confess at the end I don&#039;t know what to say. They are one the most enjoyable characters that you want to end up together I have ever shipped. It&#039;s story is very heavy at times and to say it&#039;s a tear jerker is an understatement. The animation is very pleasing and it&#039;s just overall a very enjoyable and well played out piece. Nearly every\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286702">\n        character has a backstory and has enough personality to be enjoyed that you don&#039;t mind when time is spent on them.

The animation is very good and the characters that are included in this one are all worth their contribution. The best of the four movies in my opinion because of it&#039;s basis. A recommended watch if you were a fan of the series and especially if you were interested in the two main characters, Ichigo and Rukia, relationship. An interesting plot and overall worthy watch. Out of the four movies it&#039;s plot and concentration in the connection of Ichigo and Rukia share is\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286701">\n        it&#039;s strength in my opinion and what made it the best of the four.\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286701" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286701">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286701"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286701">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286701" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286701" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

rule. Obviously the illustrations of the novel are more detailed and have their own style, I think the anime took a step back simplifying the original design, however that is the norm in an adaptation, however, in key scenes and high impact the &quot;White Fox&quot; studio does a good job.<br />\r\nAlso, among the wide range of characters do not find great complexity, rather act according to what the script requires, hindering its development, and even more so when Subaru dies and history repeats itself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn conclusion, the enjoyment in general is great, this anime is anything but boring, yes, it is a fantasy that seeks the insertion of the viewer, but taking into account the technical work and how beautiful our protagonists are, we can say that the series It is suitable for casual and moderately recommended.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReview sin espoilers hecho por m\xc3\xad \xf0\x9f\x98\x82.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSer\xc3\xa9 franco, el \xc3\xbanico gancho de la historia es el hecho de que Subaru no pueda morir, el anime es entretenido y llega a emocionarte, adem\xc3\xa1s, las diferentes y escandalosas situaciones le prestan dinamismo al gui\xc3\xb3n, despertando la creatividad de los escritores.<br />\r\nLuego de ello, hay situaciones cotidianas, hay comedia, romance, malentendidos, y como no, tensi\xc3\xb3n sexual entre nuestros protagonistas, adem\xc3\xa1s, el tan famoso tri\xc3\xa1ngulo amoroso que puede llegar a despertar tu frustraci\xc3\xb3n y romper con tu paciencia si ta gusta leer mucho.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEl arte y la ambientaci\xc3\xb3n es natural de un videojuego de rol japones, quitando a los secundarios hechos por CGI, por lo dem\xc3\xa1s el arte es t\xc3\xadpico.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLa m\xc3\xbasica est\xc3\xa1 bien, tenemos desde coros diab\xc3\xb3licos como jingles, m\xc3\xbasica medieval, un opening raro, hasta un ending super pop que no saldr\xc3\xa1 jam\xc3\xa1s de tu cabeza.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLos personajes est\xc3\xa1n bien, los dise\xc3\xb1os de los protagonistas, los vestuarios y los colores son los indicados, incluso el dise\xc3\xb1o de Subaru cumple la norma de &quot;menos es m\xc3\xa1s&quot;. Obviamente las ilustraciones de la novela son m\xc3\xa1s detallados y tienen estilo propio, creo que el anime dio un paso hacia atr\xc3\xa1s simplificando el dise\xc3\xb1o original, sin embargo esa es la norma en una adaptaci\xc3\xb3n, sin embargo, en escenas clave y de alto impacto el estudio &quot;White Fox&quot; hace un buen trabajo.<br />\r\nAsimismo, entre la amplia gama de personajes no encontramos gran complejidad, m\xc3\xa1s bien act\xc3\xbaan de acuerdo a lo que requiere el gui\xc3\xb3n, entorpeciendo su desarrollo, y m\xc3\xa1s a\xc3\xban cuando Subaru muere y la historia se repite.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEn conclusi\xc3\xb3n, el disfrute en general es genial, este anime es de todo menos aburrido, s\xc3\xad, es una fantas\xc3\xada que busca la insercion del espectador, pero teniendo en cuenta al trabajo t\xc3\xa9cnico y a lo lindas que son nuestras protagonistas, podemos decir que la serie es apta para casuales y medianamente recomendable.\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286700" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286700">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286700"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286700">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286700" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286700" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

It can be quite slow at times depending on how much you are enjoying the certain storyline it is focusing on at the time. There are a few fillers that are either hit or miss. Not to sat they aren&#039;t enjoyable but for me they just weren&#039;t that enjoyable. As with a lot of things the first series is probably the best, the introduction to Ichigo&#039;s character and his eventual &quot;friendship&quot; with Rukia is always enjoyable to watch. Unfortunately, for me later series didn&#039;t live up to expectation for me and as the\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286697">\n        cancellation led me to read the manga which at some points led me to hope maybe it would be picked up again. Unfortunately, again, by the time the final chapters came around I wasn&#039;t really worried i for would be continued or not as I was disappointed with the overall direction the series took. Not to say it wasn&#039;t enjoyable and I still hold some of the characters very dear to me and enjoyed their designs immensely(Byakuya, Shunsui, Toshiro *when he levelled up ;)*) for varied reasons... If you do venture into the bleach series it has many enjoyable aspects and depending on how you view the ending, satisfactory or not, it&#039;s characters are the thing that will keep you intrigued I think more than it&#039;s plot. \n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286697" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286697">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286697"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286697">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286697" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286697" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

The four elementary school\xe2\x80\x99s girls are all have an Kawayi personality\xef\xbc\x8cwhat I mean is\xef\xbc\x8cfour differently typical kinds of cute personalities of which you will always bump into some kids,even teenagers and adults in our real life. In other words,the four lolis are the embodiment of four respective dispositions,which are face-saving,obedient,mischievous and mediocre (\xe2\x80\x9cChika\xe2\x80\x99s characteristic is having no characteristic\xe2\x80\x9d,opined Nobue).<br />\r\nBy the way, there are some scurrilous remarks/barrages over the naughty girl Miu Matsuoka,since\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286696">\n        some people are likely to regard the \xe2\x80\x9cwild kids\xe2\x80\x9d like Miu as unfairly privileged under the perception that they are condoned too much by the society,without gaining any punishment from their perturbing behaviour. Not to mention the irreplaceable function of Miu\xe2\x80\x99s role in pushing forward the storyline,I must state that Miu is not the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cwild-chid\xe2\x80\x9d whose manners are brazen,unbridled and unscrupulous. Surely,Miu is a cute girl full of mischief and harboring no secret of her eagerness to be pampered by Nobue. But you will sooner identify Miu ,in fact,is so caring about Nobue,Chika,and Ana from many scenes and details.And that is why I love her so much, that is also why the rest of the main casts love her so much. You know,even if the fanservice anime,in which loli is not meant to always be obedient just like the girls at work in the Maid House.<br />\r\n  Just like the user @MrGaz said,this the series you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t miss.I do hope that more people would encounter and find pleasures from it.<br />\r\nP.s: Does anyone like me think each time the Teacher asks the boy seating behind Ana to stand outside as a punishment without any reason is so funny. This is not mean I support the school bully \xef\xbc\x8cI just think the nonsensical punishment is a joke of stream-of-consciousness\xe2\x80\x99 style to some extent.\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286696" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286696">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286696"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286696">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286696" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286696" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

I finally got around to it and ended up binging it. I&#039;ll admit to not having read the manga at times it can get a little confusing, especially at the end of series two where, for me at least, it felt like I had been thrown into something I didn&#039;t understand, such as in the &#039;Spring Thunder Chronicle&#039; where I felt a little lost and perhaps had missed an episode. I think the remedy to understanding the jump would be to read the manga to fully understand the\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286695">\n        situation. Overall,  the anime was very enjoyable and the characters, especially Fai and Kurogane, really carry the series. Enjoying it as I did and being a fan of quite a few things that CLAMP have produced, I wouldn&#039;t be averse to a reboot, perhaps even going further in the manga. Not all English dubs are as good as you hoped but I thought the voice cast was also very good again, Fai&#039;s and Kurogane&#039;s voice actors stand out. An enjoyable series that if nothing else will leave you wanting more.\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286695" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286695">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286695"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286695">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286695" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286695" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

At least, not referring to what a habitual viewer of animes usually sees. It is in fact a very particular product, which courageously renounces the claim to be popular to propose something more refined, more precious. To get a taste of it, it is even sufficient to look at the opening theme, exclusively musical, which, thanks to the instrumental component, manages to convey a plurality of sensations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPerhaps &quot;delicate&quot; is the adjective that best fits this series. Delicate is the atmosphere that you breathe, delicate relationships between the characters and their world, delicate the progress of the plot.\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286694">\n        &quot;Haibane renmei&quot; is not an anime that is in a hurry. From the beginning, he takes us and takes us to another &quot;plane of existence&quot;, in a quiet world populated by men and characters with an angelic aspect (in fact the Haibane), who are the protagonists of the story.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story will continue with its rhythm, adding numerous questions here and there: what are the Haibanes? What&#039;s outside their oasis of peace? Who is behind everything that happens? And so on, because it seems clear that the appearance is such that the life of the Haibanes is a life of transition. The answers will come with the dropper. However, this is for the viewer a source of disturbance or frustration. After all, the oriental philosophy makes the lack of answers and the consequent incentive to always be looking for them one of its pins.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany are provided for clues, but none is decisive, and so one can only create great conjectures about what this story really means. Is it a metaphor for purgatory? A limbo? Or something else? This can bore those who seek action or defined finals, but I believe that the underlying consistency is important, and &quot;Haibane renmei&quot; is consistent with itself. The drawings, the music, the animations, everything blends perfectly into the groove drawn by the plot.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndeed, as far as I think, I can not think of any particular criticism to do. This is not an absolute masterpiece, but certainly a work of the highest level.

It&#039;s usually the first thing that takes my interest in an anime, obviously not a deal breaker but this anime&#039;s theme was very enjoyable for me and relaxing. The style of the anime is different to what I had seen before and I for one really enjoyed it&#039;s style and it&#039;s storyline. All the characters were enjoyable which, for me, isn&#039;t always the case as most of the time there is at least one character that I don&#039;t really like but this anime has well rounded characters that I thoroughly enjoyed for\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286693">\n        different reasons. Overall it&#039;s not a stressful anime or overly dramatic, it&#039;s storyline is interesting enough to keep me interested and is definitely one I&#039;d watch again. A pretty chill anime that has a satisfactory ending.\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286693" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286693">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286693"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286693">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286693" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286693" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right;

Another advantage, at least for me\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286692">\n        that I play chess and also know shogi, is the setting in the Japanese professional world; then it is interesting how the inner torments of the protagonist are presented, the traumas he has suffered, in general how his daily life is painted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nToo bad that all these positive aspects are immediately ruined! Why all those infantilisms? The cats that talk, the president of the shogi association that at sevant years behaves and makes a film as a thirteen, the professor of the protagonist who seems to be his age and at school he sleeps lunch sitting on the stairs with him ... it would be so difficult to be a little &#039;more serious and realistic?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet&#039;s move on to two other flaws, and they are big. First, the space dedicated to the inner travails of the protagonist is too broad: many episodes are largely boring, in my opinion it would be possible to better understand the personality of the supporting actors (an example for all: the half-sister from the murky life, which seems to nourish feelings ambivalent and therefore &quot;morbid&quot;). Second flaw: it is impossible not to compare with &quot;Hikaru no Go&quot; as anime for the promotion of traditional Japanese games (there the go, here the shogi), and &quot;Un marzo da leoni&quot; comes out beaten: what sense has to spend ten minutes to make cats dance that explain the shogi moves, as if the audience were made up of five-year-old children, and then in other episodes show very complicated sequences of matches with the &#039;ideogrammed&#039; pieces without a minimum of comment? Is there anyone who is not a seventh dan who understood those moves? At least in &quot;Hikaru no Go&quot; there were explanations of the matches, and after each episode a tutorial held by a professional helped the spectator appreciate the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn short, a disappointment of Anime<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286692" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-286692">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Freviews.php%3Ft%3Danime%26_location%3Dmal_h_m" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle286692"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="286692">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=286692" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=286692" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right; text-align: right;">\n      <div title="8:33 AM">Aug 17, 2018</div>\n      <div class="lightLink spaceit">\n                  12 of 12 episodes seen\n              </div>\n      <div>\n        <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$(\'#score286691\').toggle()">Overall Rating</a>:\n        9\n      </div>\n    </div><div class="mb8">\n        <strong>\n          <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/35376/Himouto_Umaru-chan_R"\n             class="hoverinfo_trigger" id="#revArea35376" rel="#revInfo35376">Himouto!

Umaru-chan, an anime about a Mary Sue and how she abuses her brother to get what she wants. This may not seem like a good story for an anime but hear me out, this anime is hilarious!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUmaru Doma is a girl that&#039;s popular in school, she has good grades and friends, however, when she comes home, she turns into a lazy monster, a spoiled brat who gets everything from her brother. This is the second season of Umaru causing chaos and while I enjoy both I think the second season does a better job with the characters, especially Umaru. The second season doesn&#039;t do\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review286691">\n        much to change the story but it does have little side stories like Umaru&#039;s childhood friend Ebina trying to express her feelings to her crush, which adds to the comedy. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you want a good comedy I would suggest watching Himouto! Umaru-chan and the second season, but I&#039;ll admit that this series isn&#039;t for everybody. If you don&#039;t mind a little sister being mean to her older brother for a couple episodes then I think you would enjoy Umaru-chan\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_286691" class="mt8
